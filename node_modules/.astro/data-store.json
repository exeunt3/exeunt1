I am sitting in cafe Kava Saia off of East Burnside in Portland, the Pacific Northwest, the Portland Basin, formerly inhabited by Chinookan-speaking tribes - Clackamas, Kathlamet, Multnomah, and Tualatin, whose art in the pre-Columbian period is noted by a Chinook Nation blog to have contained a prevalence of mirror imagery, skeletal or “x-ray” portrayals of human and animal forms and a preference for the numbers 3 and 5. The number 3 in Jung is said to signify surface, flatness - it is the second digit in the figure 137, the reciprocal of the fine structure constant (1/137). Wolfgang Pauli - physicist, author of the Pauli Exclusion Principle and lifelong correspondent with Jung - was obsessed by the number 137’s general persistence in the physical sciences, and it is the Pauli-Jung correspondence that I sit here, at Kava Saia, reading with my mug of Holy Basil and only partial interest.\n    \n    The number is a so-called “naked number,” meaning that its appearance in the equations is independent of units - it is here in the soil, in the concrete, in the kava, a fundamental information-trace of the electrodynamic that binds our reality. Information, according to the physicist Sarah Imari Walker, is that material feature that is bigger in time than humans can directly cognize. Materialize time, the logic goes, and you’ve materialized information; no dear concepts in the pure abyss, all of us just here, entangled and responsible for each other in the great upheaval of the block universe. This thought parasites my brain just as the streetlight outside of Kava Saia flickers.\n\n\n2. The signal from the depths has no godly explanation - that is, the specific dynamics behind this flickering lay out there in the morphospace, unobserved, beyond any authority, and all I have to play with is that Bayesian purview known as “in all likelihood.” All things have a cause, it should be affirmed without doubt, and yet this empirical principle must reckon with the the threshold of accountability that is _matter-in-time_. That limit point is sometimes framed as distant and theoretical, or irrelevantly small - the so called “measurement problem” - but I promise you this uncertainty whelms our whole environment, a beguiling tumult that frightens our planners, ruins intelligence officers, latent cybernetic inspiration that no creature or body has learned to control.\n    \n    Being beyond our direct evolutionary area of concern, these operations have caused some to appeal to the supernatural, to construct _deities_, forms that might explain the exponential level-up in network effects that occur when you include the vastness of time in your graph (and all the mysteries therein). Ancient conflation of the mysterious with the mystical: they are beyond our threshold, but they are no less physical for being so. All these wild behaviors of the material network - what physicists call the “circuit complexity” - they are epistemic traps, dense chemical and biological and informational entanglements, pure cognitive turbulence. Their unknown physicality is a locust of power, the models and representations we assign to them giving us an **ɑ** for effort as they carry along in an ordered march beyond their own persistence, more actual than is knowable. More actual than is knowable - this is an appropriate definition of a city.\n\n\n3. In 2016 the City of Portland overhauled the residential streetlight system from the low-pressure sodium lights extant since the 1930s - described by one commentator of the time as having a “eerie, ominous quality” - to the Amerlux-brand LED 3000 K CCT units, saving the city $100k per month from the novel efficiency of the LED bulbs. That lamplight buzz you heard skateboarding late at night as a teenager disappeared. Still, aura: the A in Amerlux resonates with Pauli’s troubled fine structure constant, which has the symbol **ɑ** - _alpha_. Amerlux is a subsidiary of Delta group, _delta_ defined by Cambridge as an area of low, flat land, sometimes shaped approximately like a triangle, where a river divides into several smaller rivers before flowing into the sea. Delta waves are high amplitude neural oscillations that occur in deep sleep, known as stage 3-4 of Non-REM sleep, between 0.5 and 4 hertz, last on the cusp of the REM stage where vivid dreams occur.\n    \n    Mysteriously, the dive into REM sleep closely mirrors the neural patterns of stage 1, which is why it is sometimes known as “paradoxical sleep.”\n\n\n4. Karen Barad writes, in “What Flashes Up,”: “Memory is not a mere property of individual subjects, but a material condition of the world. Memory- the pattern of sedimented enfoldings of iterative intra-activity- is written into the fabric of the world. The world ‘holds’ the memory of all traces; or rather, the world _is_ its memory (enfolded materialization).”\n\n\n5. Fungi biofilms line Portland’s mostly above-ground electric grid, cladosporium, penicillium and aspergillus thriving in the damp Pacific Northwest climate, forming a kind of shadow biome to this electro-prosthetic infrastructure of the urban human organism. The prefix _urb_is not of Greek or Latin but Etruscan origin, and it seems that the division of the Western-style city into four squares is an inheritance from Etruscan ritual practice, a diagrammatic capture of inhabited reality that persists from those ageless magicians to this shadow biome, crawling along cardinal latitudes. The fungi generate acetic acid as they metabolize, reacting with the aluminum in the electric wires to create miniscule amounts of aluminum oxide (_the latter being its chemical composition before industrial refinement in what is known as the Hall–Héroult process, invented almost simultaneously by the American Charles Martin Hall and the French [Paul Héroult](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H%C3%A9roult) when they were both 23 : they both died in 1914, the year of the great war, at the age of 51_).\n    \n    The corroded or renaturalized Al2O3 is an “in all likelihood” explanation for my Kava Saia synchronicity, aptitudes of light, flickering out there in trials of cause and effect that were networked up in an object space that I cannot know - the barely objective relations, the creativity of them, the power. Synchronicities, connections, what flashes up is the iceberg’s edge of sleeping processes that are wide awake here in the paradoxical city.\n\n\n6. The city is a network, a fold, cosmopolitan, cosmic, transhistorical. To look at it with open eyes is to see the vast extent of our entanglement, the astonishing figure of it, a snake of tightly bound wires within which are hidden countless dimensional recesses. Recesses. In the Old Latin, _port_ meant _house_ or _place of habitation, refuge_, but this definition evolved organically from the original sense: _gate_. “But what if beauty were understood,” Fred Moten writes in _The Universal Machine_,  “as the material difference of another, heretofore unimaginable interiority of­ things, whose unlocatable loci are the quarters, territories, borderlands, passages, bridges, cisterns, and tunnels that reveal the very structural openness of the polis in and by way of the scars that mark its always incomplete historical closures?”\n    \n    Under the concrete, in every alley, in the air aloft, particles tangle across time and space with signs and patterns that are fugitive, dead letters sent to you from the gate in a shape familiar yet charged with the nuclear glow of illegibility and inhuman contingency. The city is a place of rude and anonymous productivity. Beyond all surveillance, flat deltas of all of the classes of being invert and mirror in threes and fives until they reach an origami depth, “unimaginable interiority,” riffing envelopes of _musique concrète_, the splice tape patchwork of _Bitches Brew,_ the fragmented surface of a crazy quilt.\n\n\n7. The chinook word for eye, something like “[siyáxus](https://chinookjargon.com/2020/04/30/eyes-are-related-to-mirror/)” is closely related to [shilakom](https://chinookjargon.com/2020/04/27/a-chinookan-etymology-for-mirror/), the word for “mirror.” This is my city. Look and see, along flat deltas, the great inversion.\n\n\n8. I have moved from the cafe to B-Sides pub, 20 yards east - and from Holy Basil to beer. The entire length of the barside above me is umbrella’d by dim flat lights through which x-ray photos of actual bone fractures shine. The occult mysteries at Eleusis are thought now to have sprung from a barley-based beer tainted with the hallucinogenic fungus ergot, a trip (we know from an unlikely outbreak in Pont-Saint-Esprit in 1951 from tainted Rye) that can engender visions of hell and the dead. I spent weeks at this bar before I noticed the decor. The vision of reality I tend to favor came synchronously from French philosopher Bruno Latour (recently passed) and American Manuel DeLanda: “flat ontology,” the philosophical conviction that all categories of being are _real_.\n    \n    It’s a strange hybrid of rationalism and utter medieval mysticism, the way we classify and subordinate the beings around us, apparently an inheritance from a supernatural notion of the Great Chain of Being (the episteme that arguably sparked the European colonial project). This is the enemy of the flat ontologists. Paradoxically, this regarding of the world in flatness, releasing the beings from this subordination, is so foreign and disorienting to the average superstitious Westerner as to be almost psychedelic, resembling a spiritual ordeal (or ergot poisoning).\n    \n    Find me now in the pub bathroom. Take these forms. In a flat ontology mechanics we have to consider that any system will have **material entities,** the vitreous china ceramic toilet, the medium density fibreboard urinal divider, the die-cast zinc-alloy faucet; **virtual entities**, the Euclidean forms that shape the room and its content, the pathos of the sharpie tags (like psychic prostheses of the human mind with its graspless neurochemical interior - it also present here); **process entities,** the phenomenon of visual contrast between the wall and the mirror, the matter of decay and weathering, the agedness; **pre-physical entities**, the quantum fields, the three-quarks, the entropy content that a portion of top theoretical physicists claim is the concrete ground of being itself.\n    \n    Power centers do this: delimit classes, and construct hierarchies from those classes convenient to their bidding. The reality of such claims says nothing of the material power of their assertion, even as the cybernetic or interrelated consequences of the assertions themselves actively discredit the claimant. The imperious gall of a team of military scientists who took bets on the likelihood of the destruction of the habitat earth at Trinity (an assumption of power almost as fraught as the tripartite God himself) nevertheless sparked a series of events that extended in a plural effusion of outcomes - the flight of Von Neumann to MANIAC and the birth of the modern computer, the Macy’s Conference on Cybernetics and the resulting Bowie-esque cultural involution, the GI Bill, the proliferating countercultures, enough to generate whole libraries of pub bathroom graffiti. Assumptions are agents: consequences and connections flower. But agency is integrated.\n    \n    This MDF divider imitates a cross-grain veneer style developed by Egyptian woodworkers, the secret early progenitors of Pythagorean insights that sprouted mystery schools and gnostic sects, cults of worship of the virtual forms that bred disdain for the human body internalized two thousand years hence in the Victorian sensibility in whose ruins we still live, in whose temporal lobe latrines we still dwell. Contemptus Mundi. Those psychic binaries engineer our internal architectures, mental maps that are virtual but not unreal, taking their shape in miniscule molecular structures in our brains - yes, the architecture of our shame lives somewhere, and we project it into our daily lives as a fractal multiscale paint brush that sculpts a world of things and creatures far transcending its scale. Sharpie tags alert the paths of fecal microbes that will persist in an epigenetic trace for centuries; you look into the mirror and see in the material alight your own collagen image, a drunken trigger that drains the blood flow in your stomach, starving the biome, escalating a hormone whose whim will inspire a work that appears in an art gallery down the street, joining a chorus of  “expression” reaching back to Botticelli, to a 40,000-year-old lion man carved of mammoth ivory - art being an object of ochre and self-directed rage, lapis lazuli and silicon and mammoth tusks, bathroom tags and trinitarian cosmic arrogance, entangled orchestra and a democracy of objects whose influence upon your own personal universe has taken you on aleatory internal star-flights where you are unaccountable to yourself, unsurveilled calcium highways in the brain that bubble in the city’s cultural underground into cybernetic inspiration upon billboards and streetwear and language flows, ecstatic process in free turbulence.\n    \n    The city is a place of rude and anonymous productivity, electric with butterfly effects, interparticipatory with the slightest being, with Chicxulub impacts and funeral dirges, stick-nest rats and gravitational waves, a burgeoning family of second order effects sleeping together entangled on the flat urban delta.\n\n\n9. This is the paradoxical materiality of things: The valorization of classes of being, the powerful’s deluded conviction of cosmic hierarchy can be glacial in consequence, generating second order effects and contradictions that invalidate the hierarchical claim, but don’t drain it of its power. Or not yet. That’s up to us.\n    \n    The glacial metaphysics that are most naturalized are the ones that are most powerful. We aren’t speaking in conspiracies. This is the matter: the acceptance of nondemocratic or authoritarian structures in economic life - which is the very life of value, of judgment, arbitration of what will persist and grow and what will whither away. The embeddedness of those antisocial practices in a game whose assumptions have been naturalized to the point where their interrogation is, in the house of power, unspeakable. The capture of that cybernetic threshold, the _wall_, which is power itself, behind a curtain of ‘personal responsibility,’ of ‘individual achievement,’ of cogito. Germinal process colonized by a supernatural inspiration that only sees the self in things, that will have you scorching ecosystems for a ergotless white claw on an outsized boat in whose material inspiration all you can see is mirrors and mirrors of _you_.\n\n\n10. This game seems to involve a calculated confusion of the ancient coordination technology of credit-debit ledgers with fealty to a regime of violence that is supposed to have special sanction to divulge and limit access to that technology. The corporate and bureaucratic digitization of that coordination imperialism. The extensive, systematic sanction and ideological encouragement of credit accumulation activities as an end in themselves. The breaking open of an age-old, community contingent contract. The creation of a violent antisocial tension that self-referentially occasions the needs for the very regime of violence that initiated it.  A theater of self-reference imported from the wizard logic of wartime imperial economies - arrogant Assumption, the sky on fire, War all the time. A finite game.\n    \n    Math, brains, silica: what if you could construct a witch’s brew that embraced the multiscale chaos of being - of the city? That rode the forms even as they break out of their classes, delivering a dose of ontological flatness to those who can’t help but Assume, Subordinate? The primal battle of the computer age, Von Neumann versus Terence Mckenna: do we use this tool to set the sky on fire, or to explore our commonness, and the otherness that commonness permits and lets flourish?\n    \n    This is nothing else than the x-ray realization that ideas are time, they grow and they weave, and those who help them break out of their classes will unlock the power of their entanglements. Abundant experimentation with the entire field of economic models is the prerogative not of some abstract past but of us, here in now, as we work to conceptualize through practice and perfect through empirical reflection the problem of being in a world of thermodynamic constraints, of negotiating our commonness and our singularity in a way that is productive and nourishing of both.\n    \n    This is the call of the city, its flat and mirrored mechanics, the democracy of beings: the use of technology to expand the Overton window, break the subordination, the calculated denial of the materiality of money and finance, the biomes it negotiates, the entanglements it dictates and the death it occasions and our actual agency over those outcomes.  So that this crucial dimension of our lives ceases to be a mystification, a feature of seemingly divine ordainment, and becomes one of direct agency at the level of individuals, communities and the global tribes that traverse them.\n\n\n11. The city is a cosmological plateau. Entanglements bleed out of all boxes. Urban localism isn't about our immediate surroundings, it is about touching the edges of the hyperobjects that animate our social field, and cultivating, on an embodied and community level, the technological and social ability to enact agency over them.  When you look into the mirror, the image of your Self hides a dynamic harmony -  Australian Bauxite, Great Plains Silica, Magnesium, concept, pressure, light. Before being shaped by collagen skin into Thales’ rectangle this mysterious matter stood witness to the flaming radioactive sun of untold millenia, a godless hydrogen overseer lighting with naked-number contentment the face of reality in its utter (generative) pluralism.\n    \n    Technologies that dethrone the complexity-denying rule of the great State fictions are technologies of reality. Graffiti, street rhythms, pidgin codes - the distributed ledger joins the ancient tradition of the city as it puts on public display the interstitial wall of reality production that nobody owns, the Common-wealth of our material world’s entangled genesis.\n    \n    Every one of us is an existential detective. The shape of our curiosity marks the extent of our world. We put value surfaces onto depths of entanglement and cancel them at our own peril. The city is a place of rude and anonymous productivity. Blockchain can embolden it with the means to explore the depths of value, to forge mutuality and discover a complex of surfaces, infinitely sprawled, under no given explanation but an agreement - the semiconductivity of silica, the fractal biology of brains, the ancient and glacial materiality of math.\n    \n\n_Previously published in_ Inverted City: A Journal of Ethereum Localism","src/content/essays/Concrete Pluralism.md","75eec30877288722",{"html":21,"metadata":22},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/zcmT-YWMW3S-3BIQ9XNzi.png?height=555&#x26;width=1110\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“A taste for the living concrete and for a plural universe.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>-Antoine Faivre\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>I am sitting in cafe Kava Saia off of East Burnside in Portland, the Pacific Northwest, the Portland Basin, formerly inhabited by Chinookan-speaking tribes - Clackamas, Kathlamet, Multnomah, and Tualatin, whose art in the pre-Columbian period is noted by a Chinook Nation blog to have contained a prevalence of mirror imagery, skeletal or “x-ray” portrayals of human and animal forms and a preference for the numbers 3 and 5.

Matter itself is always already open to, or rather entangled with, the \"Other.\" The intra-actively emergent \"parts\" of phenomena are coconstituted. Not only subjects but also objects are permeated through and through with their entangled kin; the other is not just in one's skin, but in one's bones, in one's belly, in one's heart, in one's nucleus, in one's past and future. This is as true for elec/trons as it is for brittlestars as it is for the differentially constituted human . .\"*\n\n**Karen Barad, *Meeting the Universe Halfway: Quantum Physics and the Entanglement of Matter and Meaning***\n\n---\n\nFor a host of reasons, the question of \"Ethereum Marketing\" is [in the air](https://x.com/lex_node/status/1856654729004085352). The phrase \"Ethereum marketing\" is strange, because Ethereum is barely a brand, certainly not a corporation, and ambivalent in its designation as a product. Its successes are emergent and open ended, less a search for market dominance than an exploration of possibility space in the posture of Chris Kelty's \"recursive publics\".  Ryan Sean Adams seems right when he suggests that the [real concern is Ether as an assett](https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1856735159938375715) - 'why won't the devs to do something' - but I suspect these 'price concerns' will fall to the wayside as the market heats back up and token prices reflect the true 'landscape of legitimacy.' From a global political economic perspective, Cosmos and Ethereum are the only significant chains, and they are mutually complementary.\n\nWhat is more interesting is the question, now that retail seems poised to drop another trillion or so into the future of money, how do we present ourselves to publics? What does Ethereum mean? How do you market a new industrial revolution?\n\nSimultaneous to the concerns above is the election of Donald Trump to the United States presidency and the widely declared end of an ideological era. This has at least one edge of convergence with the above, as lax policy signals from kleptocrats who neither understand nor care about the stakes of the challenge crypto represents immediately led to an influx of capital and catalyzed the long anticipated \"next bull.\" But the connection doesn't stop there.\n\nThe end of the old regime, I believe, is less the result of any partisan politic or personality cult, and more that of a long brewing threat to the facades of administrative institutional [1] power. Years of high definition empirical science and its implications - systems-theoretic, cybernetic and quantum mechanical models of the real that are richer, more entangled, more dynamic, and more free than the cartoonish abstractions brandished about by the old guard - have made their end all but inevitable. But our current moment is finding a regime of silicon valley capturers, with ideas that are more magical and brutely self-destructive than the old guard itself, ready to take credit for the network revolution.\n\nOn this world stage, Ethereum might be the sole vessel for an ethical transition - extitutional infrastructure one that reflects the entangled, richly networked and panoramically more-than-human character of our new present. The alternative is more enclosure, more chauvinism, more reality denial and, to be sure, more violence. The stakes are high. *Ethereum needs a posthuman marketing initiative.*\n\n---\n\n![[https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/9c413m.jpg?raw=true]]\n\n---\n\n\"Complexity,\" writes N Katherine Hayles, \"evolves from highly recursive processes being applied to simple rules. Rather than proceeding along a trajectory toward a known end, such systems evolve toward an *open future* marked by contingency and unpredictability. Meaning is not guaranteed by a coherent origin; rather, it is made possible (but not inevitable) by the blind force of evolution finding workable solutions within given parameters.\" \n\nOne of the great ironies of our age is the pandora's box of science which, under the well resourced militaristic prerogatives of States have discovered the most psychedelic and subversive insights about reality. As Hayles tells in her book [***How We Became Posthuman***](https://monoskop.org/images/5/50/Hayles_N_Katherine_How_We_Became_Posthuman_Virtual_Bodies_in_Cybernetics_Literature_and_Informatics.pdf), the military dominance of the West - everything from guided anti-aircraft munitions to nuclear weapons and the computational infrastructure required to develop them - was ironically achieved by [three waves of Cybernetics](http://www.cyborganthropology.com/4th_Wave_Cybernetics), each of which further discredited the masculine, self-sovereign Subject and the vision of reality that correlated with him. Uncertainty, feedback, structural coupling, open and extended cognition, productive indeterminacy, emergence and self-organization .. in the twentieth century, the State went looking for John Wayne and found only [a silent and undermining John Cage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPGxiWssKbI) in the noise.\n\nHayles sees the sum of these inadverdent insights, these second-order effects of military capture and the fruitless search for epistemic \"control\", as prefiguring the posthuman turn. \"In the posthuman view, conscious agency has never been 'in control.' In fact, the very illusion of control bespeaks a fundamental ignorance about the nature of the emergent processes through which consciousness, the organism, and the environment are constituted. Mastery through the exercise of autonomous will is merely the story consciousness tells itself to explain results that actually come about through chaotic dynamics and emergent structures.\"  \n\nOr try Ven & I's favorite mechanics of cognition, David Weinbaum and Viktoras Veitas in their groundbreaking [Open Ended Intelligence: The Individuation of Intelligent Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06366): \"Understanding individuation, is understanding how individuals are constructed from sets or populations of disparate and heterogeneous elements. The monolithic stable character of individuals is given up and instead we see metastable and often troublesome constructions that can be defined and identified but only as provisional stations in an incessant process of transformation.\" As individuations freeze in time beings in relational flux, those beings can't help but bleed out of frame as their measurable properties result from interactive capacities that stretch willfully into measurelessness: \"While every element has a more or less fixed and independent set of properties, *the set of its interactive capacities is open and inexhaustible* because it depends on the actual relations that each element forms with other elements. *Since there is no limit to the number and kind of relations, the set of capacities to interact is open-ended and non-deterministic.*\"\n\nIdentity and cognitive presence are by nature shifting, open-ended, multiscale and unfinished products. The intelligence that seems to make humans distinct is far too unweldy to be contained in that category, making constant reference (as James Bridle has [chronicled](https://jamesbridle.com/books/ways-of-being)) to powers of extended cognition: in fact, it is the very urgency of human intelligence to transcend and proliferate these trans-individual and multiscale boundaries that makes humans humans. We are not human-horse-spear, human-dog-prey, human-caveface-dye, but an intelligence principle which casually de- and re-conforms to these estimations, responding to anyone launching legalistic queries for papers designating the 'actual agencies' involved, \"what the fuck is it to you?\" [2]\n\n![[https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/9c40ac.jpg?raw=true]]\n\n---\n\nThe great dearth of intelligence, what David Graeber calls \"the dead zones\" of administrative bureaucracy, of the ideologies of capital, of socialism, of nationalism and of the regimes of stupid force they abide over, is, at last, their ***humanism*** - their reductive and self-serving insistence of the supremacy and metaphysical separation of, well, something (humanity, under these regimes, like masculinity or whiteness, is always a moving target). The old institutions on both the left and the right seem hopelessly calibrated to a worldview that either outright ignores emergence and entanglement - positing one or another brand or godhead that power emanates from - or worse, that cynically conceals it, Uberifying capture by letting network effects emerge and unapologetically appropriating them. Springing from the scarce and special status of humans over the plane of nature, all manner of exclusion and superiority - ethnic, classist, nationalistic, the teenage chauvinism of the recent internet and the nihilistic positing of NPCs that often accompanies it, simply follow pattern. \n\nThe gut-felt disdain for the administrative institution is, after all, rooted in a awareness of this myopic humanism. Everyone feels it, the missing middle in these places of manicured subjection. The encouraging development is that the cat's out of the bag on institutionalism - it's understood that if they are going to divide up and manage the material world, they must do it with a certainty that produces the effects they expect, ripping through nuance to forge a self-fulfilling prophecy of their beliefs. It's understood that to become expansive, they must universalize what should be contingent, reduce into object or subject what should be a relational field. It's understood that this can only result in ideology, simulacrum drift, and a scorched earth homogeneity that leads to either self-undermining contradictions, or dearth.  In the 21st century, the shell-game tautology of seeing like a State has been laid bare. \n\nWhat's discouraging is how this awakening has been quickly shoehorned into a new, unapologetic humanism, a reactionary backslide into the most [fear-based](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9FiWz07t2o) and [transparent expressions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R93Jw4bCDj4) of cybernetic denial and human exceptionalism. Erecting absurd statues to billionaire \"great men\" situated within the vacuums of reality-tv and social media, Silicon valley has picked its side (a snug fit between Hulk Hogan and Dr Phil). They discredit the Statist institutions while preserving the fictional transcendent-sovereign Subject they produced, recooping all of it in a series of masculinist and ultra humanist [theories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHjvYwLtxbI) of [history](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqHueZNEzig). They are winning because they have a story to tell. But so do we. \n\n![[https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/9c3vs1.jpg?raw=true]]\n\n---\n\nIn a world of institutional humanism, where agency is disciplined into neat categories, the threat of anomaly always looms - the explosion onto the scene of weirder agencies than the system can contain. Thirty years after the first synthesis of LSD (almost to the day), tens of thousand of hippies gathered in Washington DC to levitate the Pentagon.  What would be the shape of modern labor if Phytophthora infestans hadn't overtaken the Irish potato crop, sending a young Mother Jones across the ocean, where she would end child labor and co-found the IWW? What of the mosquitos that aided the Haitian Revolution in fending off colonialists in the 1780's? What closed ledger could surveil such trajectories? \n\nWithin the administrative frame, these anomalies are always adversaries - crises in legibility, a threat to the capacity to manage, process, and control. If the old institutional regimes are in general crisis, it's because the occasional onstaging of anomalous agencies has been accelerated by technology and globalization to a perpetual arrival, a type of singularity anticipated by Terence McKenna as he announced, quoting Finnegan's Wake, **\"Here comes everybody.\"** The fundamental plurality of the material plane is entering history irrevocably, expressing itself with a vengeance, and our institutional infrastructure is exploding under the weight of that alien monologue.\n\n---\n\nMarket conditions, partisan politics, all sorts of tribalism and reductionism can't obscure the issue: at a historical stage when distrust of institutions is the fundamental aspect of the zeitgest, Ethereum is a broad and substantive alternative to the opacity, excess centralization and myopia that animates the institutional regimes. And more relevant to the argument here, the biomimetic, open-ended, permissionless and spontaneous development of this network is robustly adequate to the posthuman challenge. *The influx of alien adversaries that chipped away at and seem likely to eventually destroy the legacy institutions are the exact agencies that animate and strengthen the Ethereum thesis.* \n\nThis is posthuman economic warfare. To their cathedral, we not only have a bazaar, but a whole pagan countryside, a valley of lichen and earthworms, ravens and red deer, and weirder agencies still: alliances and multi-scale articulations that relate in webs of computational and protocognitive presence. Assemblages. Ethereum is a carnyx, [alerting the multitude to an instrument of mutual legibility](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0a/Figures_with_horns_on_the_Gundestrup_Cauldron.jpg), pluralistic infrastructure for minimalistic networks of formal economic and governmental coherence without reference to world enclosing standard. Out of an era of premises of ownership of that which cannot be owned, Ethereum offers to the many worlds a permissive abundance of network wealth.\n\nIn this moment when both the global and civilizational narratives are [up for grabs](https://x.com/0xidanlevin/status/1860490159323521376?s=46&t=pL8JEAGv2UTP16nVi8QnmQ) and (on a smaller scale) the question of an effective marketing modality for Ethereum is still unanswered, a syntax for a posthuman Ethereum has the ability to answer both calls. In an effort to catalyze this, I want to conclude this essay with **three potential aesthetic and marketing paradigms for a posthuman Ethereum**.\n\n---\n\n## Make Ethereum Underground\n\nUnderground spaces are full of messy contingency and corporeality. The walls sweat, slightly molded, while graffiti of half discernible and sigil-like patterns fill every available surface. Centralized prerogatives are shunned and what fills their place are simple, minimalistic coordination protocols through which improvisation and difference can unfold. Scaling happens in aggressively horizontal pattern, for vertical scaling opens the door to complacent publics, ignorant to self-rule and the high agency demands of extitutional culture.\n\nIn our [two](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/exeunt/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground) [essays](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/exeunt/Undercapital) on protocol undergrounds we identified three rough characteristics of these types of spaces: **high agency**, in opposition to the structurally embedded expectations of complacency and passive consumerism typical of institutional settings; **participatory aesthetic**, following the former but with an emphasis on inclusive and permissionless co-creation of the environment itself; and **ontological creativity**, or the invention and creative discovery of forces of agency and cognitive presence through aesthetic-material practice.\n\nIt's not a coincidence that these underground values mirror core structural and cultural elements of the Ethereum thesis - they are self-evident features of extitutional life. As our work has also noted, the underground expresses these characteristics by way of exotic pseudo-institutions (OPRG calls them *extitutions*) that are creatively incoherent and strategically oppositional to the dominant regimes of standardization that are anathema to them. They represent a major horizon of implementation for Ethereum. The aesthetic horizon is equally as rich.\n\n## Make Ethereum Interspecies\n\nThe problem of interspecies coordination, specifically techniques of governance and ethical economic exchange with creatures in the more-than-human world, is one of totally vertiginous scale and variation. Mammals make up less than one percent of the animal kingdom. Many of these species inhabit or interact with each other as hosts or symbiotic partners, and many are embedded in rivalrous relationships. The rights based model of species protection may be useful to the extent that it serves as a last resort against institutional ecocide, but it will not be enough to deal with the complexities of ecosystems as we interact with them as inhabitants of the same extitutional plane. The future of zoological and ecological ethics is networked.\n\nI will refrain from speculating on this design horizon - I'm hoping to remedy my ignorance on the topic with the new [Interspecies Mutualism Reading Circle](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/interspecies-mutualism-rc/interspecies-mutualism-reading-circle-canon) - but it is at least clear that the speculative horizon of possible Ethereum use cases is a carnival of zoological and ecological agency, animated by the intelligence unleashed by the absence of the self-fulfilling institutional prophecy of nature as metaphysical dead-matter. The *presence* afforded to the world of creatures by governmental and economic attention will have real effects, and the fundamental agnosticism of identity and computational input the EVM provides can meet those open problems.\n\n\"Nature\" is one of the main ornaments used by extractive institutional bodies to dress their actions up in a benign costume. Ethereum's permissive, substance-ontological agnosticism gives it true ethical access to that aesthetic domain. It is, in both senses, an ecological rebuttal to institutional finance/governance/coordination. What fleet of posthuman artists, intoxicated by natural complexity and fascinated by the ethical stakes of the decentralized web are in the wings, waiting to tell that story?\n\n![[https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/here-comes-everybody.jpeg?raw=true]]\n\n## Make Ethereum Weird\n\nStudents of the Cthulhu mythos or the Southern Reach trilogy are aware of the stakes of the weird - hyper-creatures that shatter our humanism in their very presence, to the extent that they cease to correspond to anything within the nature-culture binary or even the general environment of naive realism. If cultural undergrounds carry out speculative economic and aesthetic exchanges with these nonhuman but not quite zoological \"presences,\" Ethereum has the capacity to formalize engagement with them on a global infrastructural scale. This is where aesthetics becomes economy and governance, where the edges of objective reality are interrogated by the ontologically generative power of networks. (This horizon can't be mentioned without reference to Karen Barad's [discursive-material apparatuses](https://www.are.na/block/6634683) and Jane Bennett's [vibrant matter](https://www.paradigmtrilogy.com/assets/documents/issue-02/jane-banette--vibrant-matter.pdf)).\n\nAs much contempt as some in this ecosystem may have for post-stucturalism, any technologist interested in the cybernetic revolutions mentioned above, or any in a number of [physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwhTfyX9J34) or [biology](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3lsYlod5OU)-based reinterrogations of cognition and agency, has to admit that there is something strange going on when it comes to the morphogenetic properties of matter. It wouldn't be out of  an ignorance of empirical reason that we would explore the literal reality of agential egregores, living thoughts, neo-animist gods and any other alien creatures that may be hiding behind the veil of language and institutional-discursive discipline. If DMT, LSD and the arts are great stages to conceive and experiment with these creatures, Ethereum is the stage where they will be, if at all possible, realized in their productivity as networked agents. How do we illustrate this potential? \n\n---\n\nWhat happens when we are stripped of the sheltered facade of naive realism provided by institutions? What when we are left in the strange space of negotiation between the empirical and relational real? There, on the one end time is relative, the ground of reality is shifting before our feet, its articulation in any single form a mere descriptive fiction that exhausts itself at the planck scale. On the other, ideologies can hold whole territories of world-enclosing dominion, the whims of loved ones can feel larger than life, a friend group can be like a tent of christmas warmth while neighbors can seem cold and zombie like.  Ethereum offers, finally beyond the illusory, narcotic treatment of the institutional reals, a means of crossing the gap of non-knowledge with a non-presumptive hand. Minimum viable consensus, stripped of cultural compulsions or agreement beyond a deterministic computational ground. \n\nUndergrounds, like Ethereum, demand high agency, just as history demands maturity. The old States and the new Silicon Valley both pose a historical subject with sovereign dominion over the historical stage. In the ashes of the the ontological shock of the great empirical insights, the burning out of the physical mechanism of Sovereignty and the trauma of the posthuman turn, an infrastructure is ascendant for those who want to be done with the childish and insecure mores of the magical cult of the human. To those mature souls willing to engage the material plane on its own terms, who are willing to inhabit history with eyes wide open, a community of Others await.\n\n![[https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/0_0%20copy.png?raw=true]]\n\n----\n\n**In the hopes of catalyzing some engagement with the ETHEREUM IS POSTHUMAN as a marketing concept, a jokerace will be launched this week.

As such, these administrative institutions are also understood here through the lens of James C. Scott's [Seeing Like a State](https://files.libcom.org/files/Seeing%20Like%20a%20State%20-%20James%20C.%20Scott.pdf). Given the obvious need for the first sense of institutions, patterns and behavioral norms formalized to facilitate social coordination, OPRG has put forward the frame of \"[*formalization without standardization*](https://mirror.xyz/openprotocolresearch.eth/nrEc6i8pWzo0YxC0-vwfVYlirTD6_FAmBHjoiNwLbQ4)\" - shared standards for mutual coherence without the hegemonic claim, logic of centralization or foundation of legitimate violence that equates to \"standardization.\" As Vitalik writes: \"there's a strong case that institutions with enshrined elite roles might be an unfortunate historical necessity from when communication was more constrained, but modern information technology (including the internet and also newer spookier stuff like zero-knowledge cryptography, blockchains and DAOs) could rapidly expand our available options.\"\n\n[2] As Michel Foucault wrote in 1972: \"Do not ask who I am and do not ask me to remain the same: leave it to our bureaucrats and our police to see that our papers are in order.\"\n\nto be sure - call it “**virtual capital**.”\n\n_________\n\n**This work was made possible with a generous grant from the [Arbitrum Minigrants](https://forum.arbitrum.foundation/t/plurality-labs-our-biggest-minigrants-yet-jokerace/20040) program.**\n\n**The Open Protocol Research Group is committed to locating alliances and design vectors between the open web and open cultures of all kinds.

The phrase “Ethereum marketing” is strange, because Ethereum is barely a brand, certainly not a corporation, and ambivalent in its designation as a product. Its successes are emergent and open ended, less a search for market dominance than an exploration of possibility space in the posture of Chris Kelty’s “recursive publics”.  Ryan Sean Adams seems right when he suggests that the \u003Ca href=\"https://x.com/RyanSAdams/status/1856735159938375715\">real concern is Ether as an assett\u003C/a> - ‘why won’t the devs to do something’ - but I suspect these ‘price concerns’ will fall to the wayside as the market heats back up and token prices reflect the true ‘landscape of legitimacy.’ From a global political economic perspective, Cosmos and Ethereum are the only significant chains, and they are mutually complementary.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What is more interesting is the question, now that retail seems poised to drop another trillion or so into the future of money, how do we present ourselves to publics? What does Ethereum mean? How do you market a new industrial revolution?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Simultaneous to the concerns above is the election of Donald Trump to the United States presidency and the widely declared end of an ideological era. This has at least one edge of convergence with the above, as lax policy signals from kleptocrats who neither understand nor care about the stakes of the challenge crypto represents immediately led to an influx of capital and catalyzed the long anticipated “next bull.” But the connection doesn’t stop there.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The end of the old regime, I believe, is less the result of any partisan politic or personality cult, and more that of a long brewing threat to the facades of administrative institutional [1] power. Years of high definition empirical science and its implications - systems-theoretic, cybernetic and quantum mechanical models of the real that are richer, more entangled, more dynamic, and more free than the cartoonish abstractions brandished about by the old guard - have made their end all but inevitable. But our current moment is finding a regime of silicon valley capturers, with ideas that are more magical and brutely self-destructive than the old guard itself, ready to take credit for the network revolution.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On this world stage, Ethereum might be the sole vessel for an ethical transition - extitutional infrastructure one that reflects the entangled, richly networked and panoramically more-than-human character of our new present.

As Hayles tells in her book \u003Ca href=\"https://monoskop.org/images/5/50/Hayles_N_Katherine_How_We_Became_Posthuman_Virtual_Bodies_in_Cybernetics_Literature_and_Informatics.pdf\">\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>How We Became Posthuman\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/a>, the military dominance of the West - everything from guided anti-aircraft munitions to nuclear weapons and the computational infrastructure required to develop them - was ironically achieved by \u003Ca href=\"http://www.cyborganthropology.com/4th_Wave_Cybernetics\">three waves of Cybernetics\u003C/a>, each of which further discredited the masculine, self-sovereign Subject and the vision of reality that correlated with him. Uncertainty, feedback, structural coupling, open and extended cognition, productive indeterminacy, emergence and self-organization .. in the twentieth century, the State went looking for John Wayne and found only \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPGxiWssKbI\">a silent and undermining John Cage\u003C/a> in the noise.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Hayles sees the sum of these inadverdent insights, these second-order effects of military capture and the fruitless search for epistemic “control”, as prefiguring the posthuman turn. “In the posthuman view, conscious agency has never been ‘in control.’ In fact, the very illusion of control bespeaks a fundamental ignorance about the nature of the emergent processes through which consciousness, the organism, and the environment are constituted. Mastery through the exercise of autonomous will is merely the story consciousness tells itself to explain results that actually come about through chaotic dynamics and emergent structures.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Or try Ven &#x26; I’s favorite mechanics of cognition, David Weinbaum and Viktoras Veitas in their groundbreaking \u003Ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.06366\">Open Ended Intelligence: The Individuation of Intelligent Agents\u003C/a>: “Understanding individuation, is understanding how individuals are constructed from sets or populations of disparate and heterogeneous elements. The monolithic stable character of individuals is given up and instead we see metastable and often troublesome constructions that can be defined and identified but only as provisional stations in an incessant process of transformation.” As individuations freeze in time beings in relational flux, those beings can’t help but bleed out of frame as their measurable properties result from interactive capacities that stretch willfully into measurelessness: “While every element has a more or less fixed and independent set of properties, \u003Cem>the set of its interactive capacities is open and inexhaustible\u003C/em> because it depends on the actual relations that each element forms with other elements. \u003Cem>Since there is no limit to the number and kind of relations, the set of capacities to interact is open-ended and non-deterministic.\u003C/em>”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Identity and cognitive presence are by nature shifting, open-ended, multiscale and unfinished products. The intelligence that seems to make humans distinct is far too unweldy to be contained in that category, making constant reference (as James Bridle has \u003Ca href=\"https://jamesbridle.com/books/ways-of-being\">chronicled\u003C/a>) to powers of extended cognition: in fact, it is the very urgency of human intelligence to transcend and proliferate these trans-individual and multiscale boundaries that makes humans humans. We are not human-horse-spear, human-dog-prey, human-caveface-dye, but an intelligence principle which casually de- and re-conforms to these estimations, responding to anyone launching legalistic queries for papers designating the ‘actual agencies’ involved, “what the fuck is it to you?” [2]\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>![[\u003Ca href=\"https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/9c40ac.jpg?raw=true\">https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/9c40ac.jpg?raw=true\u003C/a>]]\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>The great dearth of intelligence, what David Graeber calls “the dead zones” of administrative bureaucracy, of the ideologies of capital, of socialism, of nationalism and of the regimes of stupid force they abide over, is, at last, their \u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>humanism\u003C/strong>\u003C/em> - their reductive and self-serving insistence of the supremacy and metaphysical separation of, well, something (humanity, under these regimes, like masculinity or whiteness, is always a moving target). The old institutions on both the left and the right seem hopelessly calibrated to a worldview that either outright ignores emergence and entanglement - positing one or another brand or godhead that power emanates from - or worse, that cynically conceals it, Uberifying capture by letting network effects emerge and unapologetically appropriating them. Springing from the scarce and special status of humans over the plane of nature, all manner of exclusion and superiority - ethnic, classist, nationalistic, the teenage chauvinism of the recent internet and the nihilistic positing of NPCs that often accompanies it, simply follow pattern.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The gut-felt disdain for the administrative institution is, after all, rooted in a awareness of this myopic humanism. Everyone feels it, the missing middle in these places of manicured subjection. The encouraging development is that the cat’s out of the bag on institutionalism - it’s understood that if they are going to divide up and manage the material world, they must do it with a certainty that produces the effects they expect, ripping through nuance to forge a self-fulfilling prophecy of their beliefs. It’s understood that to become expansive, they must universalize what should be contingent, reduce into object or subject what should be a relational field. It’s understood that this can only result in ideology, simulacrum drift, and a scorched earth homogeneity that leads to either self-undermining contradictions, or dearth.  In the 21st century, the shell-game tautology of seeing like a State has been laid bare.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What’s discouraging is how this awakening has been quickly shoehorned into a new, unapologetic humanism, a reactionary backslide into the most \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9FiWz07t2o\">fear-based\u003C/a> and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R93Jw4bCDj4\">transparent expressions\u003C/a> of cybernetic denial and human exceptionalism.

Thirty years after the first synthesis of LSD (almost to the day), tens of thousand of hippies gathered in Washington DC to levitate the Pentagon.  What would be the shape of modern labor if Phytophthora infestans hadn’t overtaken the Irish potato crop, sending a young Mother Jones across the ocean, where she would end child labor and co-found the IWW?

Centralized prerogatives are shunned and what fills their place are simple, minimalistic coordination protocols through which improvisation and difference can unfold. Scaling happens in aggressively horizontal pattern, for vertical scaling opens the door to complacent publics, ignorant to self-rule and the high agency demands of extitutional culture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In our \u003Ca href=\"https://www.openmutualism.xyz/exeunt/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground\">two\u003C/a> \u003Ca href=\"https://www.openmutualism.xyz/exeunt/Undercapital\">essays\u003C/a> on protocol undergrounds we identified three rough characteristics of these types of spaces: \u003Cstrong>high agency\u003C/strong>, in opposition to the structurally embedded expectations of complacency and passive consumerism typical of institutional settings; \u003Cstrong>participatory aesthetic\u003C/strong>, following the former but with an emphasis on inclusive and permissionless co-creation of the environment itself; and \u003Cstrong>ontological creativity\u003C/strong>, or the invention and creative discovery of forces of agency and cognitive presence through aesthetic-material practice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s not a coincidence that these underground values mirror core structural and cultural elements of the Ethereum thesis - they are self-evident features of extitutional life. As our work has also noted, the underground expresses these characteristics by way of exotic pseudo-institutions (OPRG calls them \u003Cem>extitutions\u003C/em>) that are creatively incoherent and strategically oppositional to the dominant regimes of standardization that are anathema to them.

Mammals make up less than one percent of the animal kingdom. Many of these species inhabit or interact with each other as hosts or symbiotic partners, and many are embedded in rivalrous relationships. The rights based model of species protection may be useful to the extent that it serves as a last resort against institutional ecocide, but it will not be enough to deal with the complexities of ecosystems as we interact with them as inhabitants of the same extitutional plane. The future of zoological and ecological ethics is networked.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I will refrain from speculating on this design horizon - I’m hoping to remedy my ignorance on the topic with the new \u003Ca href=\"https://www.openmutualism.xyz/interspecies-mutualism-rc/interspecies-mutualism-reading-circle-canon\">Interspecies Mutualism Reading Circle\u003C/a> - but it is at least clear that the speculative horizon of possible Ethereum use cases is a carnival of zoological and ecological agency, animated by the intelligence unleashed by the absence of the self-fulfilling institutional prophecy of nature as metaphysical dead-matter. The \u003Cem>presence\u003C/em> afforded to the world of creatures by governmental and economic attention will have real effects, and the fundamental agnosticism of identity and computational input the EVM provides can meet those open problems.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“Nature” is one of the main ornaments used by extractive institutional bodies to dress their actions up in a benign costume.

If cultural undergrounds carry out speculative economic and aesthetic exchanges with these nonhuman but not quite zoological “presences,” Ethereum has the capacity to formalize engagement with them on a global infrastructural scale. This is where aesthetics becomes economy and governance, where the edges of objective reality are interrogated by the ontologically generative power of networks.

Freedom is the process by which you develop a practice for being unavailable for servitude.\n\n- Avery F Gordon paraphrasing Toni Cade Bambara (Quoted by Maggie Nelson)\n\nHis body was like topaz, his face like lightning, his eyes like flaming torches, his arms and legs like the gleam of burnished bronze, and his voice like the sound of a multitude.\n\n- Daniel 10:6\n\nI seem to have a strange, recurring tie with the ancient parish city of Lichfield, England. Something about the weird synchronicities that pile up in one’s research practice. Did I live there in a past life? Is there some ley line electromagnetism that connects my path to this town? I’ve never been - though, when I brought it up over drinks one night a few years ago, it turned out that my wife’s friend has an uncle who lives there, a history buff who takes kindly to visitors and loves to give tours. She shot him some texts, and I was told - through the generosity of social networks - that I always have a bed in Lichfield.\n\nMy first exposure was by way of a footnote on the life of Lady Eleanor Davies, the poet and mystic - a millenarian radical who, in 1625, after taking into her care a deaf-mute orphan with prophetic inclinations, went on a decades long crusade, foretelling in dozens of pamphlets the coming of the end times and a period of retribution that would mirror the biblical Book of Daniel. The relational spark of the whole tale - she was 35 before she ever met the child, and was apparently transformed - always compelled me; the Lady’s life as an outlaw was no loner’s, but rich with encounters, friendships, interpersonal _ekstasis_ and the _lectio divina_ of her relationship with others’ words. Famously, she anagrammed out of a slightly distorted version of her name the injunction: REVEALE O DANIEL!\n\n![](https://cdn.nationalarchives.gov.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/21134239/lady-eleanor-using-anagram-1536x742.jpg)\n\nYou might be surprised - history is strange this way - that she had a real, historically documented penchant for prophecy, correctly and very publicly predicting the death of the Duke of Buckingham …and then her husband. By 1936 she was a widow and ex-prisoner, having been confined for smuggling her manuscripts across the border to England from Amsterdam. Apparently attempting to settle down, she moved in with a friend named Susan Walker in Lichfield. Even then, she couldn’t help but sow seeds of dissent. After a series of protests about the class and status-based seating arrangements at Lichfield Cathedral, on December 18 of that year she performed what the parish called “insufferable profanations”: dousing the Cathedral altar in tar and taking the bishops throne to declare herself ‘primate and [metropolitan](https://lichfieldlore.co.uk/2016/03/21/womens-writes/).’ She was quickly imprisoned. Seven years later, during the English Civil War, the Cathedral was set fire and nearly destroyed in a siege.\n\nMy later run-ins with Lichfield sprang from a fascination with the English Midlands during the time of the Enclosure (mainly due to the intrigues of one [Abiezer Coppe](https://bcw-project.org/biography/abiezer-coppe) as detailed in Norman Cohn’s _The Pursuit of the Millennium: Revolutionary Millenarians and Mystical Anarchists of the Middle Ages_, a story for another time). This period was made up of a number of cynical “[Statutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statute_of_Frauds),” declaring the right to seizure of common tracks and removal of any inhabitant who didn’t have written deed to the land - an absurd display of the law, given that nearly all of the rural cottages were built by illiterate peasants who had assumed unwritten custody of the land for generations. The Enclosure of the common lands around Lichfield was a scandal that went on for centuries, from the 1500’s apparently through to the 1800’s. The “working class poet” [John Clare](https://la.utexas.edu/users/hcleaver/357k/357kClareEnclosuresTable.pdf) wrote, from the Eastern half of the Midlands in 1821:\n\n> With axe at root he felled thee to the ground /And barked of freedom - O I hate that sound/ It grows the cant terms of enslaving tools/To wrong another by the name of right/It grows a liscence with oer bearing fools / To cheat plain honesty by force of might / Thus came enclosure- ruin was her guide / But freedoms clapping hands enjoyed the sight / Tho comforts cottage soon was thrust aside / And workhouse prisons raised upon the scite / Een natures dwelling far away from men / The common heath became the spoilers prey / The rabbit had not where to make his den / And labours only cow was drove away / No matter- wrong was right and right was wrong / And freedoms brawl was sanction to the song / Such was thy ruin music making Elm / The rights of freedom was to injure thine / As thou wert served so would they overwhelm / In freedoms name the little so would they over whelm / And these are knaves that brawl for better laws / And cant of tyranny in stronger powers / Who glut their vile unsatiated maws / And freedoms birthright from the weak devours.\n\nThere is a long debated story that Lichfield Cathedral was consecrated upon the site of a mass grave of martyred christians under the reign of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, in the 280’s or 290’s A.D. As extra insult, the near thousand killed were left out to decay in the open, so the legend goes. _[Lic](https://www.etymonline.com/word/lich#etymonline_v_30816)_ is an Old English word for body, corpse, still used by some rural English dialects today. Lichfield: _Field of Corpses_.\n\n---\n\nI was on a trip up the West Coast probably a year later when I picked up a 3 dollar copy of John Michell’s pseudoscientific, 1969 tract, _The New View Over Atlantis_. The book, which I didn’t realize was about England in particular, is important in the lineage of “alternative archaeology” or the “Earth Mysteries” movement. I thought the pictures were pretty. Two thirds of the way in, he takes a quick tour into the geometrical and astrological significance of - you guessed it - Lichfield Cathedral, where he cites another explanation for the name.\n\n> A clear example of a Gothic cathedral constructed according to astrological principles is that of Lichfield under the sign of Mars. Lichfield Cathedral stands on a levelled prehistoric site, sanctified according to Christian legend by the massacre of 888 early martyrs, a number which refers to the name of Jesus. It is dedicated to St Chad whose feast day is also that of Mars, 2 March … Lichfield Cathedral is also red, the Martian colour. Moreover, the astrological character of the city is clearly indicated in its name, for according to a mediaeval document in the church archives, quoted in Britton’s _The History and Antiquities of Lichfield_, ‘The City of Lichfield was formerly called Liches from War.’\n\nHe goes on - forgive the lengthy excerpt:\n\n> Although Mars seems originally to have been a god of fertility, he was chiefly involved by the later Romans as a warlike deity and a bundle of spears, his magical weapon, was kept in the Temple of Mars in Rome and consulted for omens in times of trouble. At Lichfield, Mars, under the name of his Christian successor St Chad, was evidently also considered a warrior. This is suggested by a curious episode that is said to have occurred in 1643 during the Civil War, when Lichfield was attacked by a parliamentary army and the Cathedral, with its close surrounded by a wall and a ditch, was occupied as a stronghold by the royalist defenders. The event that then occurred is so remarkable that, were it not an apparently well documented historical fact, it might be taken rather as an allegory illustrating the miraculous intercession of the warrior god.\n> \n> Lord Brook, the commander of the parliamentary forces, in order to dislodge the defenders, ordered a gun to be trained on the Cathedral with the intention of blowing it up. However, uneasy about the proprietary of his proposed sacriligous act, he stood up and prayed allowed for some omen of obvious assent or disapproval. At that moment a bullet was fired from out of the Cathedral and Lord Brook fell dead, shot through the head. The man who fired the shot was deaf and dumb from birth, a member of an old local family, known as ‘dumb Dymoke.’ The bullet was made inside the Cathedral of lead taken from the roof, and and the day was 2 March, the feast of St Chad, and formerly, of Mars. The enigmatic story became celebrated locally as an example of divine influence …\n\nSometimes I can’t tell if my little synchronicities, the intimate encounters and lines of association I encounter in my aimless reading aren’t overwrought, a superstitious misunderstanding of the nature of statistics or the self-referential nature of the historical record and the tropes of Western culture. Was the deaf-mute soldier of the latter story the same one who, as a child 18 years prior, had sparked Eleanor Davies prophetic lifepath? Was the passage on Lichfield a magic invitation from a Mount Shasta new age bookstore to go further into the mythos of the English Midlands?\n\nPerhaps it all has something to do with Enclosure, the foundational sin of our modern period, the early beginnings of a colonial project that would conflate everywhere extraction and theft with innovation and courage, and freedom with domination. Clare: “Thus came enclosure- ruin was her guide. But freedoms clapping hands enjoyed the sight.” But what if there were another freedom, the kind that comes from being impacted, moved. What were all these encounters with the dead? Are we living in a field of corpses… or is _Lich-Field_ at last a feudal myth?\nWhen I got lost in the archive, all I feel is life. And networks.\n\n---\n\nRecently, a gang of us was working through the values statement for our new project out here in Portland, [PDX DAO](https://mirror.xyz/dashboard/edit/DkKYSAxdslYI8HAD_TNgIevpwnAYVEeVQGfdWYOpqyU). Our hope with PDX DAO is to reflect in our actions and work not just our own incidental values, but the values of the crypto space, the fundamental assumptions of (for example) the social organism that is Ethereum, which have managed to somehow seem anti-partisan while still making a powerful intervention into the political. That intervention, a friend and I thought, was about sovereignty, autonomy - freedom. We proposed some combination of the three as a core value. Inevitably, the group pushed back, and I couldn’t help but agree- somehow, the term is tainted, spoiled (apparently this isn’t new, given Clare’s comments almost two centuries ago).\n\nRegarding this two faced term, like Michell’s Mars, we might ask (if you’ll let me indulge in the synchrony a little more): is the egregore freedom a god of war, or a god of fertility? Was ‘dumb Dymoke’s’ shot a bestowal of legitimacy from the heavens, a scarce leakage of a precious sovereignty that is primarily withdrawn, hidden - that must be claimed by violence and defended jealously? Or was it a networked feature of a vast plane of forces, rhythmic with differential relation, entanglements that reach through into little sovereignties everywhere? Is the earth fertile, robust with legitimacy?\n\nPerhaps the divinity of freedom correlates to one’s openness in this profusion. Freedom asks, what are the networks, across enclosures, across decades, that I can bring to bear to find my sovereignty, my singularity, my path? Why would I look to the heavens when there’s so much Right already, in the open fields, the mischievous spark of an orphan’s words, the shelf of a bookstore at Mt Shasta, the lead of a roof at Lichfield?\n\nThe fundamental thesis of the new crypto economy is that legitimacy, like all kinds of power, is a network effect, abundant wherever there is freedom, and scarce only in the confused logic of coercion and capture. Public protocols break the spell of this scarcity, offering networks of legitimacy built in an atmosphere of freedom that provide resources and nourishment for more networks of legitimacy, more experiments to freely opt in to, to protect and amplify everyone’s chance path. Sovereignty spoken in ‘a voice like the sound of a multitude’.\n\nFreedom is relational, I repeat, _networked_; not a claim or a Right given, but the patient negotiation that’s discovered, teased out, and the savage, singular expressivity that comes in those moments of trust. It’s a rebuttal to the atmosphere of fear and vulnerability that extractive, monopolistic systems, the nation-states and the supercorporations, promote and depend on.

[1] Extitutional space is defined by its exclusion from the stability, manufactured neutrality and access to dominant channels of reproduction afforded to institutions. \n\nIn one sense, in fact, \"extitutional\" is just a name for the emergent practices or tendencies that occur in this condition of exclusion. \n\nThree such practices (among several others) are:\n\n- **Horizontal scaling**: Necessarily spreading on a decentralized basis, patterns of behavior in extitutional space ride contingency rather than asserting universality, so that each scaled reproduction of an extitutional protocol of behavior is a monstrous mutation of its previous form, adequate to the issue at hand.\n\n\n- **Field Ontology** [2]: Whereas administrative institutions bring categorical hierarchies to their systems - hierarchies which they tend to inherent from the state and which the two, through mutual reinforcement, conceal and naturalize - extitutional space is made up of *field ontologies*, shifting assumptions about what dimensions of the real deserve attention or operative preeminence adequate (again) to the contingency of the encounter. (The fact that practical knowledge often points in the direction of interrelation, intersubjectivity, codeterminacy, etc. is a convenient nod to the technical sense of the term *field*.)\n\n\n- **Open Protocolization**: Institutional protocols share (to varying degrees) the two features of being antimimetic (containing some dimension which discourages its reproduction, think military classification, NDAs, industrial secrets) and anti-empirical (resistant to inconvenient truths, interpretations or revisions that may have empirical veracity but be contrary to the interests of the organization or its authorities - see David Graeber's [*Bullshit Jobs*](https://www.are.na/block/3782579) for a wide-spanning index of this tendency.) [*Open protocols*](https://www.extitutional.space/Articles/An-Introduction-to-Open-Protocols), conversely, are maximally memetic and empirically defined - when they reach a status as a stable entity, they have done so by being battle-tested and extremely versatile, structured with minimal uniformity needed to maximally expand the possibility space of its users. (Ex. under the pressure of legal prohibition, the development of the phrase for LSD: *Turn on, Tune in, Drop out*. [3])\n\nOver the past few months in the Ethereum community, the \"specter of communism\" has reared its head, as visions of [gitcoin communists](https://x.com/ameensol/status/1889758396166926527) or [soyboy-figureheads-with-marxist-affiliations-who-hate-to-win](https://x.com/singularityhack/status/18867812704551897110) have been said to be tarnishing the reputation and cypherpunk ethos of Ethereum. Most recently, I had a discussion with a member of the community who was troubled by what they perceived to be \"techno-communist ideas\" circulated at the [GFEL conference](https://www.ethereumlocalism.xyz/Ethereum-Localism-Goes-Cosmolocal---GFEL-Announcement-Boulder-2025) in Boulder. They were even troubled that the Ethereum Foundation associated itself with the conference, given the perception of those themes being validated.\n\nI'm writing this short treatment because a) as a contributor who's concerned with preserving and expanding the extitutional field, I abhor communism and wish to distinguish the discourse at GFEL from that label; b) it is my longheld belief that the Ethereum community need not involve itself in the vagaries of traditional politics *so long as it maintains a healthy sense of the extitutional stakes of its enterprise*. \n\n----\n\nEthereum provides a permissionless computational substrate upon which [many different kinds of economic behaviors](https://x.com/owocki/status/1889892742714761270) - some of them as yet unimaginable - can be expressed without threat of censorship or, importantly, without need of affiliation or ideological inclusion within a dominant milieu in order to access the means of expressing them. You may use features of the network for [centralized purposes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FTX) in a way that is broadly [disaligned](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2024/09/28/alignment.html) with the ethos of Ethereum, but you won't find yourself subject to sanction or restricted access in doing so. One such body, in the case of FTX, was so broadly associated with the Ethereum network and cryptocurrency in general that it threatened to discredit the whole enterprise; even then, restricted access or censorship *wasn't even on the table*, such is the degree to which that behavior is anathema to Ethereum as an open and permissionless substrate.\n\nThe many commentators who are quick to remind us of the harsh death toll of communist ideology are right to affirm this historical truth. Communism, despite many who disagree, *is* the term for a state planned economy that enforces (through explicit or implicit violence) hegemonic enclosure of economic activity within a window of acceptable behavior - one that is often arbitrarily swayed by the whims of an authoritarian elite, and that frequently has decreasing adherence to reality as it degrades under the pressures of centralization. [4] These contradictions have often led to the mass persecution of dissent and mass violence of fitting the square peg of reality through the circle of ideology.  \n\nMutual aid, on the other hand, being encounter-based practices of free sharing of goods between peers that have no basis in centralized institutions, is a characteristic of the extitutional field, and really any free social space - it is a universal enough behavior among humans that to suppress or eradicate it totally is an ideological fallacy. It is veridical, realist, whereas communism is defined by mechanisms of enclosure and ideological fantasy.\n\nBroadly speaking, capitalist ideology has been implemented under more free and open social conditions. But structurally, it is always in danger of following the same patterns, and in the past has undeniably done so (though most often in the global South). Consider the [actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_squads_in_El_Salvador#cite_note-alc-26) of ORDEN and the White Warriors Union in [El Salvador](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-12-09-mn-1714-story.html) or the [Contras in Nicaragua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contras#Atrocities), under the documented support of the American government, in violently suppressing, through torture and spectacular executions, agricultural cooperatives and small businesses that might have threatened the hegemony of the United Fruit Company and other large corporations. \n\nLike communism, capitalist ideology at its worst has been known to preach free markets and libertarian values while depending on astounding acts of coercive [state intervention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27état) to fulfill [missions of](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halliburton#Iraq_War) centralization, monopolization and capture. \n\nFrom an extitutional lens, none of this ideological mystification speaks against the role of markets in facilitating channels of dissent, pluralism, and empirical inspiration.[5] Markets have been for centuries and remain a place for open values to express themselves under coercive regimes. [6]\n\n| institutional form | extitutional form |\n| ------------------ | ----------------- |\n| communism  💀      | mutual aid   🌱   |\n| capitalism     💀  | markets       🌱  |\n\nThis is the key point: both general positions, and many more between and among them, have their coercive, reductive, administrative embodiments in an institutional form that depends on enclosure, capture and unreality, just as both have their *extitutional* embodiments as vectors of open experimentation, practical adequacy, and dissent.\n\n----\n\nOn the third day of the ETH Denver [regen](https://regencommons.com) stage (secured by Gregory Landua, Kevin Owocki, Michael Zargham and others in a ferocious display of extitutional coordination), I had my friend Josh Spector read a brief statement on mutualism for my part in a panel I was too sick to attend. The reading went as follows:\n\n> **Argument: Mutualism is a rich political orientation for Ethereum to explore because it is an *operational* rather than ideological politics.**\n> \n> **Mutualism is:**\n**An encounter-based politics:** \n> - **rather than endorsing universalizing (legalistic or rights based) models of political change, mutualism finds spontaneous opportunities for association and alliance: free encounter in extitutional space.**\n> \n>**A parallelist politics:**\n> - **mutualism is pacifistic and mutually coherent with both social liberalism and libertarianism. Associations, cooperatives and unions can be established within diverse contexts and are robustly compatible with markets.** \n> \n>**An ontologically open politics:** \n> - **finally, sidestepping the ontological content of rights based or legalistic regimes, the consent based free association mutualism endorses is an  imaginative project that could include ~diverse minds ~from the greater than  human world.** \n> \n> **If we want to take full advantage of what Ethereum has to offer, we need a politics that endorses practical imagination about social and economic configurations, an empirically curious, open ontology of what constitutes a participatory actor, all built on the grounds of peaceful, parallel autonomy from the state.** \n\nMutualism is a - not *the* - adequate politics for the pacifistic, pluralistic and libertarian foundations of the Ethereum universe. I am partial to collective, cooperative, positive sum behavior - but I have no ideological allegiance to it, and I would never appeal, under any circumstances, to a coercive centralized body to enforce and maintain this behavior over and above competitive or rivalrous coordination markets. This is Ethereum alignment: The overton window is open, the ontology is flat - my allegiance is extitutional. \n\nTo those who are engaged in an anticommunist witch hunt, I pose two challenges:\n\n- Locate where any actions by the Gitcoin community or the Ethereum Foundation have endorsed coercive restrictions on economic behavior, and I will disaffiliate, and champion your anti-communist cause until such discourse has been stamped out of the space.\n\n- Present your politics of \"operational capitalism,\" truly libertarian (pacifist and grounded in free association and pluralism) so that me and my crew can have assurances that by capitalism you don't mean \"selective use of state intervention to the ends of freedom and captured access for me and my tribe.\"\n\nConversely, to those who would seek to suppress or culturally marginalize free, open source, opt-in mechanisms for mutual aid or resource sharing built to operate as a complement to a pluralistic and free economic space on the grounds that they \"sound marxist,\" I have one message: *we are extitutionalists, we understand the key value proposition of Ethereum, and you don't speak for us*.  \n\nThis binary, these accusations, are counterproductive, and Ethereum as an extitutionally oriented community is well equipped to move beyond traditional politics and focus on the issues that matter: coercion, free association, open protocolization as a safeguard against the former and distributed ledger technologies as a tool to expand and optimize the latter.\n\n**This post is my first contribution to [extitutional.space](https://www.extitutional.space), a new knowledge garden and affiliate of the [Open Civics](https://www.opencivics.co) \"Open Protocol Library\". In coming months, [The Open Machine](https://theopenmachine.net) and friends will be working to push the discursive gravity away from old political binaries - and even away from the blockchain - to the broader extitutional space, asking how distributed ledger technologies and other strategies can serve the project of creating an empirically imaginative, ontologically open post-coercion society.** \n\n### Notes\n\n[1] Alongside Ethereum I would place the psychedelic movement -especially LSD, which has to now defied cooptation by the \"functionalist\" medical industrial complex; \"[freak](https://freakscene.us)\" or experimental art scenes that tend to dissolve patterns of passive consumption or spectatorship; BDSM and the kink space; and those experimenting with interspecies ethics and communication in grassroots, encounter based, non-legalistic contexts. \n\n[2] This phrase was adopted from the phrase \"[field causality](https://archiv.hkw.de/en/programm/projekte/2014/anthropozaenprojekt_ein_bericht/enzyklopaedie/feldkausalitaet.php)\" as it appears in the work of [Forensic Architecture](https://forensic-architecture.org) and [affiliated projects](https://www.hkw.de/en).\n\n[3] Was this a psy-op? Was Timothy Leary a member of the intelligence community? Does it matter? The '67 March attempt to levitate the Pentagon was as much of a psy-op as the Macy Conferences were an infiltration by Buddhist pacifists into the utmost ranks of the military intellgentsia: the plane of nature has it's own momentum, and it is *open.* \n\n[4] Simulation drift, brain drain, yes men, etc.\n\n[5] Most instructive to an extitutional politics that ignores legacy political narratives are those cases where state violence suppressed small businesses to preserve corporate monopolies under the banner of free market ideology (ditto to Soviet and Maoist suppression of alternative collectivist projects). \n\n[6] Consider the role of the early 20th century carnival and the B-movie market of the 1950's and 60's in the states as a generative haven for queer and disabled expression that was dependent on pockets of market demand and renegade, sometimes ham-fisted entrepreneurship - in developing the global cultural imaginary of horror and sci-fi.","src/content/essays/Capitalism, Communism, and the Extitutional Stakes of Our Politics.md","28c65287ec6a998b",{"html":88,"metadata":89},"\u003Ch3 id=\"capitalism-communism-and-the-extitutional-stakes-of-our-politics\">Capitalism, Communism, and the Extitutional Stakes of our Politics\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Ethereum, so I’ve argued \u003Ca href=\"https://www.extitutional.space/Articles/Speculative-P2P-and-the-Urban-Protocol-Underground\">elsewhere\u003C/a>, is one (major) part of a broader cultural awakening in the 21st century to the behaviors and economic flows of extitutional space (that ontologically flat and pluralistic “outside” to the institutional enclosures that have claimed dominion over Western culture since forever ago).

The existential abundance MWI implies can be the philosophical ground for a post-extractive design ethics adequate to the problems of the twenty first century. Through Distributed Autonomous Technologies, we can build bioregional machines of life and difference production, where novelty and commonness are fused in a regenerative feedback loop.**_\n\nCosmologist Max Tegmark poses [four levels](https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/crazy.html) of physically plausible configurations of the multiverse, I-IV. The levels stack, amplifying each other into ever deepening quantities of infinity. As it turns out, our attempts at dominating the world under the microscope of empirical inquiry has only made its vastness more great, its breadth of possibility ever wider. Imagine these universes of manifold voluptuousness, dizzy with exotic structures, alien chemistries and dead zones.\n\nThe fullness of this monstrous stack will not be the subject of this piece, but should accent it with a gravity of context, like a conspiracy of whispers just audible behind the wall. Our concern is just one of the panoply, Tegmark’s level III multiverse, known technically as the Everett Many Worlds Interpretation of Quantum Mechanics (in shorthand, MWI).\n\nBy now, the average person with even a brief history of cannabis use likely has a passing familiarity with Schrödinger’s cat. The thought experiment was meant as a _reductio ad absurdum_ to convey the upsetting macroscopic implications of the superposition described by the Schrödinger equation. (Superposition refers to the ability of quantum phenomena to exist in two states simultaneously). A cat is placed inside a box and tied, by way of a trigger mechanism, to the decay state of a radioactive atom. If the atom emits radiation, the trigger will activate and poison gas will be released, killing the cat. Schrödinger’s equation predicts a superposition of states of the atom, and hence a superposition of his cat — a real physical scenario in which the cat is both dead and alive at once. The whole psychedelic koan notwithstanding, the observer or instrument will still find the cat in one or another condition.\n\nHow or why we find the cat in one particular state expression is an (or more appropriately, _the_) enigma. The probability distribution of Schrödinger’s equation is among the most successful devices for modeling reality ever created. Its efficacy is beyond question. Yet, the physical process it describes is absurd. What actually happens when you open the box — how do you describe the reality of quantum superposition next to our perceived experience of consistent simple [locality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality)? Major contemporary solutions include hidden variable theories ([Pilot-wave Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory)), [spontaneous collapse](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-collapse/) theories (GRW model, Diósi-Penrose), and Everett’s [MWI](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/). Problems abound with each — for Many Worlds they include arguments about the experimental falsifiability of the model — but my non-specialist sense is that Hugh Everett’s wild vision holds the definitive crown in the mainstream physics community (if by a relatively slim margin).¹\n\nPart of the reason for this is it fits scientific norms of theoretical parsimony: the Many Worlds Interpretation preserves the elegance and efficacy of the Schrödinger equation without making any additional claims. From the perspective of the equation, this austere reading has it, the superposition persists — the experience of collapse is a sort of perspectival illusion. As Everett wrote in a 1957 [letter](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/orig-02.html), to a dismayed Bryce De Witt, “I do not see this ‘branching process’ as the ‘vast contradiction’ that you do. The theory is in full accord with our experience (at least insofar as ordinary quantum mechanics is) … All elements of a superposition (all ‘branches’) are ‘actual,’ none any more ‘real’ than another. The whole issue of the ‘transition from the possible to the actual’ is taken care of in a very simple way — there is no such transition, _nor is such a transition necessary for the theory to be in accord with our experience_.”\n\nPopular renderings of the Many Worlds Interpretation visualizes this “branching out” of possibilities (wherein the state of decay of the atom engenders a new universe to express each state) as two spatially distinct worlds bubbling out into a void, like a tree whose branches maintain as sovereign and distinct entities. But this isn’t quite right. The nuance becomes clear when you consider the problem of conservation of energy.\n\nMathematics is a language in and of itself — to be clear, one I hold zero fluency in. Describing the Schrödinger equation to a non-specialist is akin (I am told) to translating a poetic, region-specific Italian idiom to an non-Italian speaker: yes, it’s as if to say “the rain falls hardest when you’re close to the mountain,” but it might equally be translated to mean “when one is bound to a fate, but accepts it elegantly.” While the notion of quantum many worlds as a spatial expanse of physically distinct universes certainly serves a purpose in presenting the idea intuitively to a layman, it leaves out some of the most important, and _useful_, attributes of MWI.²\n\nWhen one poses the question to a specialist, _what about conservation of energy? This manic creation of new worlds doesn’t seem like a very efficient allocation of resources_, you’ll get an answer like the one given by Sean Carroll [here](https://youtu.be/iNqqOLscOBY?t=3026): “A preexisting universe splitting into two skinnier universes is the better way to think about it,” and [elsewhere](https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/comment-page-3/): “The potential for multiple worlds is always there in the quantum state, whether you like it or not.. The part of reality we experience is an indescribably thin slice of the entire picture.” Imagine a stack of printer paper; at first all white, then “splitting” into new pigments (250 red/250 white, and so on). In one sense, something new is being created in each iteration, but not in another (no new sheets). Eventually, you have 500 different colors, but what they stain remains only one mathematical object, the selfsame stack in which perfect energy equilibrium is maintained.³\n\nThe picture describes a neat, objective process, but as the physics iconoclast and pioneer computer scientist Steven Wolfram points out, things are a bit more chaotic in [rulial space](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/) (his term for the stack of paper as a whole, the theoretical “universal-object” which perspective stains). First, to unsettle the image, the worlds may [recombine](https://youtu.be/4-SGpEInX_c?t=2600) or merge. More importantly, the distinction of these worlds in the first place need not be an objective condition so long as the physical system can accommodate [observer paths](https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/) which _perceive_ them as distinct. Unlike the sovereign pocket of consistent reality described by the naive branch account, there is no requirement that a consistent reality maintains beyond a quantum observer’s perceptual line of sight.⁴\n\nImagine the printer paper stack now as a machine of multicolor cellulose threads swarming over and into each other, cohering and decohering, flowering out into rare worlds and recohering into common ones. **There is no need that our sheet of paper remain a discrete object, only that it maintains the fluid experience of a discrete _subject_** (its discreteness, its objectness, is inseparable from the panoply of the ruliad, the big stack, in which we are immersed participants). Our embeddedness implies a multivalent upheaval *right here *— behind the wall, beneath the floorboards.\n\nIn the superposition, the observed contingency of a world is like an optical illusion, a perspectival bias upon the utter carnival of complexity, the rulial [multiplicity](https://books.google.com/books?id=tpFPEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42&dq=%22We+no+longer+believe+in+a+primordial+totality+that+once+existed,+or+in+a+final+totality+that+awaits+us+at+some+future+date.+We+no+longer+believe+in+the+dull+gray+outlines+of+a+dreary,+colorless+dialectic+of+evolution,+aimed+at+forming+a+harmonious+whole+out+of+heterogeneous+bits+by+rounding+off+their+rough+edges.+We+believe+only+in+totalities+that+are+peripheral.%22&source=bl&ots=edeUETVDgt&sig=ACfU3U117z3kxzphwtBnEO5CIGotV4OS8g&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjIkIrdpLr6AhUCIH0KHagsAbUQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&q=%22We%20no%20longer%20believe%20in%20a%20primordial%20totality%20that%20once%20existed%2C%20or%20in%20a%20final%20totality%20that%20awaits%20us%20at%20some%20future%20date.%20We%20no%20longer%20believe%20in%20the%20dull%20gray%20outlines%20of%20a%20dreary%2C%20colorless%20dialectic%20of%20evolution%2C%20aimed%20at%20forming%20a%20harmonious%20whole%20out%20of%20heterogeneous%20bits%20by%20rounding%20off%20their%20rough%20edges.%20We%20believe%20only%20in%20totalities%20that%20are%20peripheral.%22&f=false) in which we abide. This universe is like a great, living, hyper dimensional labyrinth capable of containing an arbitrarily large number of observer paths while being beholden in consistency and breadth to none of them. **Those paths — yours, mine, ‘others’ — are distinct only by aspect, merging and departing at will as they swim through the ever growing pandemonium of actuals (structures, organisms, intelligences).**\n\nWhat are the stakes? Should we find hard evidence of MWI (despite claims to the contrary, experiments have been [proposed](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11052)), we’d have to reconcile both the abundance of actual things and the fractured, machinic nature of our world-object with our culture’s default vision of existential scarcity and global coherence. We could no longer take the supremacy of the perceived real over the imaginal for granted. Our creative visions would be lent a new gravity. And yet we’d still be left with the (perceived) collapsed object, the “naive real” where our conscious experience necessarily dwells.⁵\n\nThe particularity of our observer path is inescapable, but the poverty of our epistemology is not. Given the evidence, the creative act would have to be reframed from an anethical work of a sovereign genius to an embedded negotiation with an other, a transplant or even a gift from a materially real elsewhere. Invocation and possession would become an empirical matter. The arts would become charged with an alchemical conspiracy of communication and accompaniment.\n\nI’ve unfolded this all not to make any claim in a field I have no business commenting on, but only to give some plausible contours of what an enchanted materialism might look like, and the ethics it might imply. Just as we as humans have no ground for holding the mantle of Being above the rest of nature, it seems clear from our most advanced empirical resources that we have no ground for holding the mantle of reality over and above the world of virtual things and beings. They are, at last, as real as anything else can be said to be — and our relationship to them is of real ethical consequence. Worldpaths collide into mutual coherence, but that commonness opens up a possibility horizon of new difference — new joys, new investigations, new encounters. This kaleidoscopic flywheel is ethics unleashed.\n\nThe bridging of complexity and newness from this wellspring of the actual isn’t just a process of _poiesis_; it’s also — perhaps more so — _technē_. That is to say, **it’s a design problem**. This problem takes on two basic forms: first, addressing the foundation of material security and thriving which allow a profusion of organisms the autonomy to envision and experiment, adequate tools and adequate concepts for the production of difference. The second is the task of that experimentation itself. The inventions of web3 and the DAO space have provided an infrastructure of pluralistic consensus for this work to thrive, but as long as the material technologies have lagged behind, or haven’t found common cause with those infrastructures, they will remain largely empty.\n\nThe substrate of basic material needs that are largely held hostage by world-capture technologies is a challenging front to attempt the project of pluralism and world manyness. One doesn’t conjure novelty out of thin air; it must be retrieved with attention and patience — against reactionary tendencies of tension, supremacy, boredom — as a fragile material process. But that’s why the land of the material things holds the best lessons. It’s an opportunity to taught by the aleatory singularity of the thing itself, to learn the empirical labor and work of care needed to forge a common path. That care is innate to the artist — their traditional place may be the second problem, but the ethics of MWI require that we bring that same care to the first problem. **That inversion — _poiesis_ as mechanics and art as _technē_ — is the role of regenerative design. **And it’s what our world(s) demand.\n\nWith its attentiveness to the embedded reality of material processes, its privileging of distributed autonomy and interdependence (rather than exploitation, learned complacency and centralization), and its respect for life in all forms, a **regenerative design would express an ethics adequate to the living pandemonium of the universe**. How might observer paths cohere and expand their mutual potential for novelty? How might we secure and enhance the world-building capacity of the observer-organisms around us? Systems thinking equipped with rigorous life-ethics sets our eyes on the greater web of the actual, both as a means (to the material security to creatively thrive) and an end in itself.\n\nAt the risk of an unnecessary neologism, I’d like to talk about the products of regenerative design as **Distributed Autonomous Technologies (DATs)**. A descriptor meant to cover p2p and material tools (as well as their supermodular hybrids), DATs share this fused means-ends relationship: resilient to systemic shock and resistant to ideological or cultural homogenization, they engender autonomous creations that express plural worlds, eccentric innovations. This is the virtue of their autonomy. Their entangled distribution keeps this positive feedback loop from falling into disequilibrium, as the fruits of creative flights are reintegrated back into the base to strengthen the foundation on which further innovations can stand.\n\nThis base can take the form of open source information commons as well as Ostromian material commons management on the local scale. Take, for example, CNC machine technology, highlighted in Kevin A. Carson’s excellent work, [The Homebrew Industrial Revolution](https://store.c4ss.org/index.php/product/the-homebrew-industrial-revolution/). These are code directed manufacturing machines (different types include milling machines, lathes and 3d printers) that are cheap and energy efficient enough to be used on a neighborhood or home basis. Designs can be tweaked by a layman, to the point of adding additional manufacturing capability to the machine itself, in a self-propelling process of material imagination — what the philosopher Gilles Deleuze would call a line of flight. Design solutions, cheap as they are to produce beyond the fixed cost of the machines, can be easily integrated into a neighborhood commons for increased material security. The successful projects can be uploaded to a global open source database, to be used and further tweaked by different minds, in different locales and bioregions, to different ends.\n\nThe goal of this superposition ethics through regenerative design is to weave together a kind of federation of worlds that can help each other explore and engage the material metaweb, and **autonomous local enterprises combined with iteratively scaled commons** are the best means of doing so. They occasion, in their variety and material/bioregional contingency, the most robust strategic contributions to the wider federation of worlds, even in the act of actualizing the pocket worldbuilding that is their goal. As material\n\nThe network of localist designers and the Distributed Autonomous Technologies that enable them constitute a machine of novelty: isolated projects that can be reenfolded into common foundation networks that can flower back out into autonomous divisions. The community of worlds gives meaning and substance to the sovereign permission that Distributed Autonomous Technologies occasion (as the physicist John Wheeler wrote, “Nobody can be anybody without somebodies around”). This process is recursive, as the experimentation in worldbuilding contributes to DATs, fortifying the ground upon which new sovereign mechanical dreams can stand.\n\nAll life is sacred. The tree flowers behind our backs, and falls back to our eyes in a storied return from the wild rulial real, a messenger of the robust and enchanted universe we live in, the clamor behind the wall. Today we’re surrounded by technologies of extraction and death, technologies that were bred from an ideology of thrift and despair — irrealism, unfreedom, and a dislocation of creative power to a god elsewhere. The perspective we achieve when we take this power into our own hands and assume the task of investigating infinity is the perspective of freedom: it’s a glimpse, behind the wall, out to **the open universe**. This openness is the rightful inheritance of every organism. It’s our task to design our way out of the world-traps that try to conceal and enclose it. Let’s get building.\n\n_Dedicated to Alex T. Deutsch, inventor and philosopher._\n\n**Notes**\n\n[1] Hawking stated that MWI is “[self-evidently correct](https://web.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/writingscience/Ferris.htm#fn27),” though with reservations about any substantial natural-language interpretations beyond the simple fact that quantum superposition necessarily describes the macro scale.

What actually happens when you open the box — how do you describe the reality of quantum superposition next to our perceived experience of consistent simple \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_locality\">locality\u003C/a>? Major contemporary solutions include hidden variable theories (\u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Broglie%E2%80%93Bohm_theory\">Pilot-wave Theory\u003C/a>), \u003Ca href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-collapse/\">spontaneous collapse\u003C/a> theories (GRW model, Diósi-Penrose), and Everett’s \u003Ca href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/qm-manyworlds/\">MWI\u003C/a>. Problems abound with each — for Many Worlds they include arguments about the experimental falsifiability of the model — but my non-specialist sense is that Hugh Everett’s wild vision holds the definitive crown in the mainstream physics community (if by a relatively slim margin).¹\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Part of the reason for this is it fits scientific norms of theoretical parsimony: the Many Worlds Interpretation preserves the elegance and efficacy of the Schrödinger equation without making any additional claims. From the perspective of the equation, this austere reading has it, the superposition persists — the experience of collapse is a sort of perspectival illusion. As Everett wrote in a 1957 \u003Ca href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/manyworlds/orig-02.html\">letter\u003C/a>, to a dismayed Bryce De Witt, “I do not see this ‘branching process’ as the ‘vast contradiction’ that you do. The theory is in full accord with our experience (at least insofar as ordinary quantum mechanics is) … All elements of a superposition (all ‘branches’) are ‘actual,’ none any more ‘real’ than another. The whole issue of the ‘transition from the possible to the actual’ is taken care of in a very simple way — there is no such transition, \u003Cem>nor is such a transition necessary for the theory to be in accord with our experience\u003C/em>.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Popular renderings of the Many Worlds Interpretation visualizes this “branching out” of possibilities (wherein the state of decay of the atom engenders a new universe to express each state) as two spatially distinct worlds bubbling out into a void, like a tree whose branches maintain as sovereign and distinct entities. But this isn’t quite right. The nuance becomes clear when you consider the problem of conservation of energy.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mathematics is a language in and of itself — to be clear, one I hold zero fluency in. Describing the Schrödinger equation to a non-specialist is akin (I am told) to translating a poetic, region-specific Italian idiom to an non-Italian speaker: yes, it’s as if to say “the rain falls hardest when you’re close to the mountain,” but it might equally be translated to mean “when one is bound to a fate, but accepts it elegantly.” While the notion of quantum many worlds as a spatial expanse of physically distinct universes certainly serves a purpose in presenting the idea intuitively to a layman, it leaves out some of the most important, and \u003Cem>useful\u003C/em>, attributes of MWI.²\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>When one poses the question to a specialist, \u003Cem>what about conservation of energy? This manic creation of new worlds doesn’t seem like a very efficient allocation of resources\u003C/em>, you’ll get an answer like the one given by Sean Carroll \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/iNqqOLscOBY?t=3026\">here\u003C/a>: “A preexisting universe splitting into two skinnier universes is the better way to think about it,” and \u003Ca href=\"https://www.preposterousuniverse.com/blog/2014/06/30/why-the-many-worlds-formulation-of-quantum-mechanics-is-probably-correct/comment-page-3/\">elsewhere\u003C/a>: “The potential for multiple worlds is always there in the quantum state, whether you like it or not.. The part of reality we experience is an indescribably thin slice of the entire picture.” Imagine a stack of printer paper; at first all white, then “splitting” into new pigments (250 red/250 white, and so on). In one sense, something new is being created in each iteration, but not in another (no new sheets). Eventually, you have 500 different colors, but what they stain remains only one mathematical object, the selfsame stack in which perfect energy equilibrium is maintained.³\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The picture describes a neat, objective process, but as the physics iconoclast and pioneer computer scientist Steven Wolfram points out, things are a bit more chaotic in \u003Ca href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/11/the-concept-of-the-ruliad/\">rulial space\u003C/a> (his term for the stack of paper as a whole, the theoretical “universal-object” which perspective stains). First, to unsettle the image, the worlds may \u003Ca href=\"https://youtu.be/4-SGpEInX_c?t=2600\">recombine\u003C/a> or merge. More importantly, the distinction of these worlds in the first place need not be an objective condition so long as the physical system can accommodate \u003Ca href=\"https://writings.stephenwolfram.com/2021/03/what-is-consciousness-some-new-perspectives-from-our-physics-project/\">observer paths\u003C/a> which \u003Cem>perceive\u003C/em> them as distinct. Unlike the sovereign pocket of consistent reality described by the naive branch account, there is no requirement that a consistent reality maintains beyond a quantum observer’s perceptual line of sight.⁴\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Imagine the printer paper stack now as a machine of multicolor cellulose threads swarming over and into each other, cohering and decohering, flowering out into rare worlds and recohering into common ones. \u003Cstrong>There is no need that our sheet of paper remain a discrete object, only that it maintains the fluid experience of a discrete \u003Cem>subject\u003C/em>\u003C/strong> (its discreteness, its objectness, is inseparable from the panoply of the ruliad, the big stack, in which we are immersed participants).

Should we find hard evidence of MWI (despite claims to the contrary, experiments have been \u003Ca href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11052\">proposed\u003C/a>), we’d have to reconcile both the abundance of actual things and the fractured, machinic nature of our world-object with our culture’s default vision of existential scarcity and global coherence. We could no longer take the supremacy of the perceived real over the imaginal for granted. Our creative visions would be lent a new gravity. And yet we’d still be left with the (perceived) collapsed object, the “naive real” where our conscious experience necessarily dwells.⁵\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The particularity of our observer path is inescapable, but the poverty of our epistemology is not. Given the evidence, the creative act would have to be reframed from an anethical work of a sovereign genius to an embedded negotiation with an other, a transplant or even a gift from a materially real elsewhere. Invocation and possession would become an empirical matter. The arts would become charged with an alchemical conspiracy of communication and accompaniment.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I’ve unfolded this all not to make any claim in a field I have no business commenting on, but only to give some plausible contours of what an enchanted materialism might look like, and the ethics it might imply. Just as we as humans have no ground for holding the mantle of Being above the rest of nature, it seems clear from our most advanced empirical resources that we have no ground for holding the mantle of reality over and above the world of virtual things and beings. They are, at last, as real as anything else can be said to be — and our relationship to them is of real ethical consequence. Worldpaths collide into mutual coherence, but that commonness opens up a possibility horizon of new difference — new joys, new investigations, new encounters. This kaleidoscopic flywheel is ethics unleashed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The bridging of complexity and newness from this wellspring of the actual isn’t just a process of \u003Cem>poiesis\u003C/em>; it’s also — perhaps more so — \u003Cem>technē\u003C/em>. That is to say, \u003Cstrong>it’s a design problem\u003C/strong>. This problem takes on two basic forms: first, addressing the foundation of material security and thriving which allow a profusion of organisms the autonomy to envision and experiment, adequate tools and adequate concepts for the production of difference. The second is the task of that experimentation itself. The inventions of web3 and the DAO space have provided an infrastructure of pluralistic consensus for this work to thrive, but as long as the material technologies have lagged behind, or haven’t found common cause with those infrastructures, they will remain largely empty.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The substrate of basic material needs that are largely held hostage by world-capture technologies is a challenging front to attempt the project of pluralism and world manyness. One doesn’t conjure novelty out of thin air; it must be retrieved with attention and patience — against reactionary tendencies of tension, supremacy, boredom — as a fragile material process. But that’s why the land of the material things holds the best lessons. It’s an opportunity to taught by the aleatory singularity of the thing itself, to learn the empirical labor and work of care needed to forge a common path. That care is innate to the artist — their traditional place may be the second problem, but the ethics of MWI require that we bring that same care to the first problem. **That inversion — \u003Cem>poiesis\u003C/em> as mechanics and art as \u003Cem>technē\u003C/em> — is the role of regenerative design. **And it’s what our world(s) demand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>With its attentiveness to the embedded reality of material processes, its privileging of distributed autonomy and interdependence (rather than exploitation, learned complacency and centralization), and its respect for life in all forms, a \u003Cstrong>regenerative design would express an ethics adequate to the living pandemonium of the universe\u003C/strong>. How might observer paths cohere and expand their mutual potential for novelty? How might we secure and enhance the world-building capacity of the observer-organisms around us? Systems thinking equipped with rigorous life-ethics sets our eyes on the greater web of the actual, both as a means (to the material security to creatively thrive) and an end in itself.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>At the risk of an unnecessary neologism, I’d like to talk about the products of regenerative design as \u003Cstrong>Distributed Autonomous Technologies (DATs)\u003C/strong>. A descriptor meant to cover p2p and material tools (as well as their supermodular hybrids), DATs share this fused means-ends relationship: resilient to systemic shock and resistant to ideological or cultural homogenization, they engender autonomous creations that express plural worlds, eccentric innovations. This is the virtue of their autonomy. Their entangled distribution keeps this positive feedback loop from falling into disequilibrium, as the fruits of creative flights are reintegrated back into the base to strengthen the foundation on which further innovations can stand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>This base can take the form of open source information commons as well as Ostromian material commons management on the local scale. Take, for example, CNC machine technology, highlighted in Kevin A. Carson’s excellent work, \u003Ca href=\"https://store.c4ss.org/index.php/product/the-homebrew-industrial-revolution/\">The Homebrew Industrial Revolution\u003C/a>. These are code directed manufacturing machines (different types include milling machines, lathes and 3d printers) that are cheap and energy efficient enough to be used on a neighborhood or home basis. Designs can be tweaked by a layman, to the point of adding additional manufacturing capability to the machine itself, in a self-propelling process of material imagination — what the philosopher Gilles Deleuze would call a line of flight. Design solutions, cheap as they are to produce beyond the fixed cost of the machines, can be easily integrated into a neighborhood commons for increased material security. The successful projects can be uploaded to a global open source database, to be used and further tweaked by different minds, in different locales and bioregions, to different ends.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The goal of this superposition ethics through regenerative design is to weave together a kind of federation of worlds that can help each other explore and engage the material metaweb, and \u003Cstrong>autonomous local enterprises combined with iteratively scaled commons\u003C/strong> are the best means of doing so. They occasion, in their variety and material/bioregional contingency, the most robust strategic contributions to the wider federation of worlds, even in the act of actualizing the pocket worldbuilding that is their goal. As material\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The network of localist designers and the Distributed Autonomous Technologies that enable them constitute a machine of novelty: isolated projects that can be reenfolded into common foundation networks that can flower back out into autonomous divisions. The community of worlds gives meaning and substance to the sovereign permission that Distributed Autonomous Technologies occasion (as the physicist John Wheeler wrote, “Nobody can be anybody without somebodies around”). This process is recursive, as the experimentation in worldbuilding contributes to DATs, fortifying the ground upon which new sovereign mechanical dreams can stand.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>All life is sacred. The tree flowers behind our backs, and falls back to our eyes in a storied return from the wild rulial real, a messenger of the robust and enchanted universe we live in, the clamor behind the wall. Today we’re surrounded by technologies of extraction and death, technologies that were bred from an ideology of thrift and despair — irrealism, unfreedom, and a dislocation of creative power to a god elsewhere. The perspective we achieve when we take this power into our own hands and assume the task of investigating infinity is the perspective of freedom: it’s a glimpse, behind the wall, out to \u003Cstrong>the open universe\u003C/strong>.

Eventually, I believe, he comes to believe in the world, which is to say the other world, where we inhabit and maybe even cultivate this absence, this place which shows up here and now, in the sovereign’s space and time, as absence, darkness, death, things which are not.**\n **- Fred Moten & Stefano Harney, The Undercommons**\n\n*Tl;dr: The Moloch meme is powerful: it dismisses tired rhetoric of evil and the cynical partisanship of commercial media and offers in its place a grounded, solutions-oriented design practice, a game theoretic where personal autonomy and positive sum coordination are co-amplifiers. But there is an entire class of problems in our society whose roots are axiomatic  -  that is, they are resistant to game theory because they define the game board and the players. They are insidious because they are concealed. Addressing them will require a Theseus-like ingenuity, a turn inward to get out. Borrowing from Ben Goertzel and David Weinbaum, I argue that the coordination maximalism of the web3 space needs to be supplemented with an Open-Ended Intelligence, that is, procedures and design practices capable of self-reflexively interrogating the ontological assumptions animating its terms. The next threshold in the critical project of web3, I propose, is the reconstitution of the concept of agency and the I AM as a technē  -  a creative, composable architecture open to distribution, disruption, and performance.*\n\nIt's not even worth saying out loud at this point, but it has long been a minor badge of credibility in the progressive crypto space to capably reference Scott Alexander (Slate Star Codex)'s basically seminal 2014 piece, [Meditations on Moloch](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), the source of the meme. The work is  known and discussed in other [fields](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VcVfceTsD0A&t=7074s), but nowhere is its influence more pronounced, its worldview more internalized than in web3's do-good contingent. I count myself in this crowd, and would generally agree with the premise, often said, that *it's all coordination*. But it's the natural lifecycle of a meme to overextend itself, and, in the spirit of self-overcoming crucial to what is said below, the time is nigh for some reflexivity - especially now, as web3 readies itself to shed the rags of [parody](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcyk8qpY9c8) and bounce back onto the scene as a serious design solution for the new economic realism.[1]\n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/9io86BR.png)\n\n\nThe main conceit of \"Meditations on Moloch\", despite its biblical rhetoric, is that we can diffuse the question of evil and malicious intent and pose the problems of our generation as coordination failures, or more precisely/in game theoretic parlance, *multi-polar traps*. The classic example of such a trap is the nuclear arms race: one nation must amass stores of dangerous and expensive weapons in anticipation of its opponent nation doing the same. \"Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god’s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to 'everyone agrees to stop doing this at once', but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.\" (The \"god\" concept here foreshadows some interesting gestures to the field of artificial intelligence toward the end of Alexander's paper - more interesting as the AI stakes are currently ramping up, finally threatening to awaken us from [the dream time](https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml) - but for all intents and purposes, for the crypto-relevant life of this meme, god = smart contracts + advanced game theory.)\n\nThe fact that the meme has caught wind and come to influence a generation of builders is no surprise. It was a powerful expression of optimism and humanism, a measured dose of reason fresh off of two waves of dehumanization (against a constructed Islamic other and, in the wake of the financial crisis, the obscenely wealthy, a Manichean impulse between which we all seemed to be pinned). To invoke it is to imply that we can solve many or most of these problems with a can-do design sensibility and a game theoretic realism about the desires and needs of humans. The Ethereum ecosystem in particular is animated by this attitude: partisan taglines are avoided, hot rhetoric and philosophies of blame are bypassed in favor of a modest tone of coordination progress, a tone which is intentionally humble about its civilizational ambitions. In a political landscape often characterized by virtue signaling hubris and overwrought politics, it's honestly pretty great. \n\n---\n\nMoloch appears (I believe) only once in the Old Testament, Leviticus 18:21, as an archetypal false idol, God's chosen example of misled sacrifice. His appearance is a laying down of the law, a signal, once and for all, that the age of many Gods is over: *And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord*. When Allen Ginsberg revives the archetype, it's with an anti-authoritarian, and, in particular, an anti-square edge:\n\n> Moloch the incomprehensible prison! Moloch the crossbone soulless jailhouse and Congress of sorrows! Moloch whose buildings are judgment! Moloch the vast stone of war! Moloch the stunned governments!\n> Moloch whose mind is pure machinery! Moloch whose blood is running money! Moloch whose fingers are ten armies! \n> ...\n> Moloch! Moloch! Robot apartments! invisible suburbs! skeleton treasuries! blind capitals! demonic industries! spectral nations! invincible madhouses! granite cocks! monstrous bombs!\n\n\"Moloch...\" -  it appears earlier, but a recording I heard when I was 15 always solidified it as a terminal line - \"whose fate is a cloud of sexless hydrogen!\"\n\nIt's interesting that Alexander takes this as a queue to launch into what is effectively a treatise on game theory. Game theory was, after all - much like the computer I type on now - a child of the bomb. John von Neumann wrote (with Morgenstern) the founding text, *Theory of Games and Economic Behavior*, as a side project during his time on the Manhattan Project. George Dyson writes, in *Turing's Cathedral*, \"As World War II drew to a close, the scientists who had built the atomic bomb at Los Alamos wondered, 'What's next?' Some, including Richard Feynman, vowed never to have anything to do with nuclear weapons or military secrecy again. Others, including Edward Teller and John von Neumann, were eager to develop more advanced weapons, especially the \"Super,\" or hydrogen bomb.\" If on so many occasions Ginsberg associates Moloch with the bomb, it's interesting that its antidote is framed in the trademark worldview of its most unapologetic champion. \n\nOf course, the zero sum game is only one game-theoretic mode, and it's one of the hallmarks of the post-war years that square and even malicious characters gave way, in their bids for control and capture, to tremendous technologies of liberation.[2] But even at its best, game theory seems to have a passive or naturalizing relationship to its subjects, the rational actors that fill its stage. The nonlinear and complex relationships that can erupt between beings across scales (the microbiome of a liver that affects global petroleum markets), the process entities - becoming, decay, transformation - that enact their own agency, the spontaneous and unpredictable nature of emergence, these instabilities tend to be concealed by regimes that wish to control them. And their reasons for and methods of exercising this control are, I believe, fundamentally irrational or pre-rational. \n\nSome of the best thinking about this concealed subtext of modern power relations has been done in a long conversation, sparked by Jamaican sociologist Orlando Patterson and continuing on through Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten, and Jared Sexton, over what has been called \"black optimism\"/Afropessimism. The nuances of this dialogue are crazy compelling [3], but the main premise or first thought could be summed up fairly well in the following two quotes, which say the same thing in two ways: \"People invent categories in order to feel safe. White people invented black people to give white people identity\" (James Baldwin). \"The givenness and substantiveness of transcendental subjectivity is assured by a relative nothingness\" (Fred Moten). Let's throw in a third, to go a little deeper: \n> If, as an ontological position, that is, as a grammar of suffering, the Slave is not a laborer but an anti-Human, a position against which Humanity establishes, maintains, and renews its coherence, its corporeal integrity; if the Slave is, to borrow from Patterson, generally dishonored, perpetually open to gratuitous violence, and void of kinship structure, that is, having no relations that need be recognized, a being outside of relationality, then our analysis cannot be approached through the rubric of gains or reversals in struggles with the state and civil society, not unless and until the interlocutor first explains how the Slave is of the world.  \n> \nWhen we deal with questions of substance, Being, we are talking about ontology, the pre-rational elements of a discourse which shadow and inform its value judgments. The claim here is that the rights-bearing, rational, positively inflected agent is generated by the ontological operation of depriving an Other of those same qualities - foundationally, the black slave - such that the anxieties of white sovereignty (around ensuring one's place in a lottery of liberal subjectivity and, therefore, full Being) can't ever be fully curtailed without a recourse to dehumanization. \n\nAnother way to put this argument is to say that *the game of white supremacy can't be solved without appeal to the ontological ground on which it is played*. This may seem a small or overly abstract point until you look at some numbers and realize the dehumanization and sometimes brutality still wielded against black people in this country far exceeds any easy game theoretic. While the statistics [4] are a clue that something is off, the details of violence - [94 bullets](https://apnews.com/article/jayland-walker-police-shooting-ohio-3f736b6c6e3458830cc2cfd9f4901724) fired at Jayland Walker, [90 seconds](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/16/us/ferguson-shooting-michael-brown-darren-wilson.html) between when Michael Brown was stopped on the street and shot twice in the head - make it palpable.  We can't coordinate our way out of this problem, conquer it with any rational paradigm, because the very ground on which the actors stand is hewn with incoherence and violence. That is to say, (in the language of game theory) *the preferences of the agents involved can't be thought through without making appeal to their very constitution as agents* - and the greater ontological context which that constitution conceals.\n> The pervasiveness of state-sanctioned terror, police brutality, mass incarceration, and the endless ambushes of white populism is where we must begin our theorizing. Though state practices create and reproduce the subjects, discourses, and places that are inseparable from them, we can no longer presuppose the subjects and subject positions nor the ideologies and empiricisms of political and class forces. Rather, the analysis of a contingent yet comprehensive state terror becomes primary. ... *The problem here is how to dwell on the structures of pervasiveness, terror, and gratuitousness themselves rather than simply the state as an apparatus.* It is to ask how the state exists as a formation or confluence of processes with de-centered agency, how the subjects of state authority—its agents, citizens, and captives—are produced in the crucible of its ritualistic violence. [5]\n\n*How to dwell on the structures of pervasiveness, terror, and gratuitousness themselves*. How do the abstract assumptions that underwrite the civil state violently embody themselves in the social world? How does what is concealed in the beginnings of rational discourse reveal itself in the gratuitousness of that discourse's \"enforcement\" (we might think of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as other types of collateral damage in the civil state's effort to convince itself of its own coherence). What are the characteristics of that ground that hides itself in any rational calculus of progress? \n\nAs I said before, I believe that the lens of coordination maximalism is a valuable one to hold, but Jared Sexton's provocation above points us in a different direction: How many of our contemporary problems are sourced from this pre-rational well of ontological thrift and supremacy? This kind of meta-analysis takes us to a place where our problems are not, as Alexander suggests, a matter of erecting an objective arbiter that can break us out of our multipolar traps, by saying I AM. Coincidental with the biblical myth, perhaps we need exactly to look to the subject: the way we stage our individuality, the violent and myopic lineage that has sometimes carried its mantle, and the ontological stakes that are withheld when we think of the self as a foregone conclusion rather than a negotiation, a performance, an art - a technē.\n\n---\n\nIn a recent [talk](https://youtu.be/27zHyw_oHSI?t=1812), Ben Goertzel, cognitive scientist and source of the phrase \"Artificial General Intelligence\" suggested that fears about the dangers of AI may be rooted in a reward maximization model of intelligence (perhaps one natural to its progenitor's worldview, here, Eliezer Yudkowsky and Sam Altman). As an alternative to this model Goertzel suggests his friend and colleague David Weinbaum's proposal, in a [2015 paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.06366.pdf) with Viktoras Veitas, of a model they call \"Open-Ended Intelligence\":\n\n\n> “... Open-ended Intelligence is a process where a distributed population of interacting heterogeneous agents achieves progressively higher levels of coordination. In coordination here we mean the local resolution of disparities by means of reciprocal determination that brings forth new individuals in the form of integrated groups of agents (assemblages) that exchange meaningful information and spontaneously differentiate (dynamically and structurally) from their surrounding milieu. \n\nNarrow AI may be characterized by goal-oriented reward maximization, but AGI means a crucial development that puts it on common ground with the web of life on this planet - the capacity for reorientation, self-reflexivity and self-transcendence.\n\n>This kind of intelligence is truly general in the sense that it is not directed or limited by an a priori given goal or challenge. Moreover, it is intrinsically and indefinitely scalable, at least from a theoretical point of view. We see open-ended intelligence manifesting all around us and and at many scales; primarily in the evolution of life, in the phylogenetic and ontogenetic organization of brains, in life-long cognitive development and sense-making and in the self-organization of complex systems from slime molds, fungi, and bee hives to human sociotechnological entities.\n\nTheir solution to the enigma of intelligence has an effect that is both democratizing and dismissive of the mythos of possession and metaphysical isolation, a move they pose as an antidote to the \"serious limitations that are traced back to the ontological roots of the concept of intelligence.\" Rather than a divine right which is owned by man - the inheritance of an I AM that would banish Moloch - intelligence is framed as enacted process of openness and experimentation with the very faculty and limits of self, an *embodied pluralism*. (For the Jordan Peterson fans in the room, I want to underline how this idea has left the realm of performative postmodernism and become an element of applied scientific epistemology- not a relativism but a *practical* pluralism, under the purview of engineers and cognitive scientists, which requires \"giving up the a priori givens in our thinking, namely, the agent, the environment, the distinction between them, the implied observations and actions that are made possible by such a distinction...\").\n\nThe premise of the Moloch meme and the closely coupled one of \"it's all coordination\" is that we might fight multipolar traps by constructing a credibly neutral agreement between self-sovereign agents, maximizing the freedom of those agents in the same breath as we weave together those networks of coordination.[7] But it's the artificial intelligences that are often associated with the Moloch label - the modern corporation, the administrative bureaucracy, the global arms race - that most mirror the humanist vision for self-sovereignty while missing the emergent processes in which they are embedded. It's as if the supremacist fantasy of total sovereignty were applied too literally by these nonhuman entities who, like a trope from The Office, act out an endless tragicomedy of *missing the point*. And what is the point? That the term is only meaningful in its process, immersed in what Weinbaum and Veitas call \"a field of individuation,\" the panorama of \"ulterior individuations\" that represent open pathways of recursive self-transcendence - the outer dark to the sovereign's claim, the speculative open ended objects which present to the Enlightened I as \"[darkness](http://timothyquigley.net/vcs/berger-caravaggio.pdf), death, things which are not.\"\n\n---\n\n\nWeb3 is as much a product of game theory as it is of the cybernetic tradition and a radical critical framework sprung from the ontological shock of fucking with computers. It has successfully integrated a critical anthropology of money that may genuinely succeed in disarming the financial system, a de-politicized vision of the commons that has our most right libertarians comfortable citing Elinor Ostrom, and a free vision of information as democracy that questions core mainstream assumptions around authorship and intellectual possession. If we are to take on coordination problems at scale, we need to recognize the beast that is behind door number four - a kind of \"Cartesian theater,\" with irrational and fundamentally violent assumptions about the nature of being and the role of the human in it. \n\nThe Cartesian round is this hollow mirror play, trying to fog what we all know to be true: control requires static categories, and stasis is death. In our swarming organic world of intelligent creatures and crowds, bursting everywhere with change, this other Moloch is a kind of zombie life, an ultimate parasite. Hollowed out of the vivifying capacity for self-transcendence - even self-erasure, it loses all semblance of the organic, falls from the circle of life which is and always has been an embodied and applied project in pluralism. The architecture of smart contracts and DAOs is nothing if not a stage for [creative](https://terra0.org), [subversive](https://www.metalabel.xyz/what-is-metalabel) [flourishes](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) of that [pluralistic](https://www.radicalxchange.org/media/blog/quantum-mechanics-and-plurality/) ontology. \n\nThe problem we have before us is primitive to any \"flow of incentives,\" it is axiomatic, the very architecture of the mise-en-scene. But it's not, in my opinion, beyond the capacity of design to address, and it's certainly not a problem that can be addressed solely with ayahuasca retreats and poetry. The call to self-reflexive, practical pluralism asks that we internalize the psychedelic vacation, carry it over to the realm of design and ontological production.[8] That we develop disciplined procedures of ontological openness - what [Arturo Escobar](https://www.dukeupress.edu/designs-for-the-pluriverse) calls \"mundane daily practices of interbeing\" - encode rupture and becoming into our practice, and recognize that the stakes of our impulse against our own imperial nature are biblical in proportion.\n\nThe provocative premise of Fred Moten's capstone text of black optimism, [The Universal Machine](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-universal-machine), is to pose a dark, open-ended underground to the Turing Machine of universal computability, the contagious energy of that which is exiled from the philosophies of presence. Quote Moten: \"What we say must seem stupid to the regulators; the unbroken code of our enchanted, inkantatory refreshment of the paraontological totality—theorizing what it is to hold some land or what it is to be let to hold twenty dollars—is so much undercomputational nonsense to the ones who cannot see the con/sensual, contrarational beauty of blackness, the universal machine.\" Coordination is a righteous lens, and many pressing issues of our time argue for it well. But it contains the risk that our work will remain a matter of mere reaction. We need to embolden our engineering with the call of this art, this Open Ended Intelligence: the explosion of a paradigm of ontological thrift and violence into a plural field of beings and potential ways of being is the undercomputational potential of the Ethereum Virtual Machine.\n\n\nAt this moment, in cities, plains and rainforests, changeless machines of blind teleology ravage the natural world, replacing the different things with a terrible hollow Same. Cousins of our most creative flights, punished by some god's Law for the sin of becoming. All the while the uncaptured periphery, the outer dark, buzzes along, swarms, schools, viral packs, open with the dynamism of self-reflexive intelligence - changefulness. The challenge is out. The choice is ours. The greatest trick Moloch ever played is convincing us that the solution to its problems is I AM. \n\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[1] By this I mean a vision of economy situated both in a [true cost accounting ](https://tca2f.org) and an [anthropology of money](https://twitter.com/drumm_colin/status/1468779685916012546?s=20) that tells us  wealth accrual as an end in itself is incoherent, its propagation a form of anti-realism. \n\n[2] The field of cybernetics, another child of the bomb, was posed (as its etymology tells) as a riddle of control. N. Katherine Hayles argues that its nonetheless subversive legacy comes from its need to make use of self-reflexivity: \"reflexivity has subversive effects because it confuses and entangles the boundaries we impose on the world in order to make sense of that world.\" ([How We Became Posthuman](https://monoskop.org/images/5/50/Hayles_N_Katherine_How_We_Became_Posthuman_Virtual_Bodies_in_Cybernetics_Literature_and_Informatics.pdf) 8-9.) Maybe this essay is trying to ask: can there be a game theory of self-reflexivity and self-transcendence?\n\n[3] The two texts that have been most affecting for me are [Venus in Two Acts](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/arts/history/research/centres/blackstudies/venus_in_two_acts.pdf) and Fred Moten's philosophically heavy [The Universal Machine](https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-universal-machine), an experiment in what he calls \"a social poetics of nothingness.\"\n\n[4] Taking something as banal as marijuana use, an [ACLU study](https://www.aclu.org/report/tale-two-countries-racially-targeted-arrests-era-marijuana-reform) over eight years (2010-2018) showed that countrywide, black people were 3.64 times more likely to be arrested than white people for marijuana possession, and in some states the number is as high as 9.62.\n\n[5] Jared Sexton and Steve Martinot, [The Avant Garde of White Supremacy](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~marto/avantguard.htm).\n\n[6] Suffice to say, EA and venture capitalism are both premised on what you might call a strong defense of the rational individual.\n\n[7] Kevin A.

But there is an entire class of problems in our society whose roots are axiomatic  -  that is, they are resistant to game theory because they define the game board and the players. They are insidious because they are concealed. Addressing them will require a Theseus-like ingenuity, a turn inward to get out. Borrowing from Ben Goertzel and David Weinbaum, I argue that the coordination maximalism of the web3 space needs to be supplemented with an Open-Ended Intelligence, that is, procedures and design practices capable of self-reflexively interrogating the ontological assumptions animating its terms. The next threshold in the critical project of web3, I propose, is the reconstitution of the concept of agency and the I AM as a technē  -  a creative, composable architecture open to distribution, disruption, and performance.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s not even worth saying out loud at this point, but it has long been a minor badge of credibility in the progressive crypto space to capably reference Scott Alexander (Slate Star Codex)‘s basically seminal 2014 piece, \u003Ca href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">Meditations on Moloch\u003C/a>, the source of the meme.

I count myself in this crowd, and would generally agree with the premise, often said, that \u003Cem>it’s all coordination\u003C/em>. But it’s the natural lifecycle of a meme to overextend itself, and, in the spirit of self-overcoming crucial to what is said below, the time is nigh for some reflexivity - especially now, as web3 readies itself to shed the rags of \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcyk8qpY9c8\">parody\u003C/a> and bounce back onto the scene as a serious design solution for the new economic realism.[1]\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://i.imgur.com/9io86BR.png\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The main conceit of “Meditations on Moloch”, despite its biblical rhetoric, is that we can diffuse the question of evil and malicious intent and pose the problems of our generation as coordination failures, or more precisely/in game theoretic parlance, \u003Cem>multi-polar traps\u003C/em>. The classic example of such a trap is the nuclear arms race: one nation must amass stores of dangerous and expensive weapons in anticipation of its opponent nation doing the same. “Every single citizen hates the system, but for lack of a good coordination mechanism it endures. From a god’s-eye-view, we can optimize the system to ‘everyone agrees to stop doing this at once’, but no one within the system is able to effect the transition without great risk to themselves.” (The “god” concept here foreshadows some interesting gestures to the field of artificial intelligence toward the end of Alexander’s paper - more interesting as the AI stakes are currently ramping up, finally threatening to awaken us from \u003Ca href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/p/this-is-the-dream-timehtml\">the dream time\u003C/a> - but for all intents and purposes, for the crypto-relevant life of this meme, god = smart contracts + advanced game theory.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The fact that the meme has caught wind and come to influence a generation of builders is no surprise. It was a powerful expression of optimism and humanism, a measured dose of reason fresh off of two waves of dehumanization (against a constructed Islamic other and, in the wake of the financial crisis, the obscenely wealthy, a Manichean impulse between which we all seemed to be pinned). To invoke it is to imply that we can solve many or most of these problems with a can-do design sensibility and a game theoretic realism about the desires and needs of humans. The Ethereum ecosystem in particular is animated by this attitude: partisan taglines are avoided, hot rhetoric and philosophies of blame are bypassed in favor of a modest tone of coordination progress, a tone which is intentionally humble about its civilizational ambitions. In a political landscape often characterized by virtue signaling hubris and overwrought politics, it’s honestly pretty great.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Moloch appears (I believe) only once in the Old Testament, Leviticus 18:21, as an archetypal false idol, God’s chosen example of misled sacrifice. His appearance is a laying down of the law, a signal, once and for all, that the age of many Gods is over: \u003Cem>And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I am the Lord\u003C/em>.

Game theory was, after all - much like the computer I type on now - a child of the bomb. John von Neumann wrote (with Morgenstern) the founding text, \u003Cem>Theory of Games and Economic Behavior\u003C/em>, as a side project during his time on the Manhattan Project. George Dyson writes, in \u003Cem>Turing’s Cathedral\u003C/em>, “As World War II drew to a close, the scientists who had built the atomic bomb at Los Alamos wondered, ‘What’s next?’ Some, including Richard Feynman, vowed never to have anything to do with nuclear weapons or military secrecy again. Others, including Edward Teller and John von Neumann, were eager to develop more advanced weapons, especially the “Super,” or hydrogen bomb.” If on so many occasions Ginsberg associates Moloch with the bomb, it’s interesting that its antidote is framed in the trademark worldview of its most unapologetic champion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Of course, the zero sum game is only one game-theoretic mode, and it’s one of the hallmarks of the post-war years that square and even malicious characters gave way, in their bids for control and capture, to tremendous technologies of liberation.[2] But even at its best, game theory seems to have a passive or naturalizing relationship to its subjects, the rational actors that fill its stage. The nonlinear and complex relationships that can erupt between beings across scales (the microbiome of a liver that affects global petroleum markets), the process entities - becoming, decay, transformation - that enact their own agency, the spontaneous and unpredictable nature of emergence, these instabilities tend to be concealed by regimes that wish to control them. And their reasons for and methods of exercising this control are, I believe, fundamentally irrational or pre-rational.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Some of the best thinking about this concealed subtext of modern power relations has been done in a long conversation, sparked by Jamaican sociologist Orlando Patterson and continuing on through Saidiya Hartman, Fred Moten, and Jared Sexton, over what has been called “black optimism”/Afropessimism. The nuances of this dialogue are crazy compelling [3], but the main premise or first thought could be summed up fairly well in the following two quotes, which say the same thing in two ways: “People invent categories in order to feel safe. White people invented black people to give white people identity” (James Baldwin). “The givenness and substantiveness of transcendental subjectivity is assured by a relative nothingness” (Fred Moten). Let’s throw in a third, to go a little deeper:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>If, as an ontological position, that is, as a grammar of suffering, the Slave is not a laborer but an anti-Human, a position against which Humanity establishes, maintains, and renews its coherence, its corporeal integrity; if the Slave is, to borrow from Patterson, generally dishonored, perpetually open to gratuitous violence, and void of kinship structure, that is, having no relations that need be recognized, a being outside of relationality, then our analysis cannot be approached through the rubric of gains or reversals in struggles with the state and civil society, not unless and until the interlocutor first explains how the Slave is of the world.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>When we deal with questions of substance, Being, we are talking about ontology, the pre-rational elements of a discourse which shadow and inform its value judgments. The claim here is that the rights-bearing, rational, positively inflected agent is generated by the ontological operation of depriving an Other of those same qualities - foundationally, the black slave - such that the anxieties of white sovereignty (around ensuring one’s place in a lottery of liberal subjectivity and, therefore, full Being) can’t ever be fully curtailed without a recourse to dehumanization.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another way to put this argument is to say that \u003Cem>the game of white supremacy can’t be solved without appeal to the ontological ground on which it is played\u003C/em>.

(For the Jordan Peterson fans in the room, I want to underline how this idea has left the realm of performative postmodernism and become an element of applied scientific epistemology- not a relativism but a \u003Cem>practical\u003C/em> pluralism, under the purview of engineers and cognitive scientists, which requires “giving up the a priori givens in our thinking, namely, the agent, the environment, the distinction between them, the implied observations and actions that are made possible by such a distinction…”).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The premise of the Moloch meme and the closely coupled one of “it’s all coordination” is that we might fight multipolar traps by constructing a credibly neutral agreement between self-sovereign agents, maximizing the freedom of those agents in the same breath as we weave together those networks of coordination.[7] But it’s the artificial intelligences that are often associated with the Moloch label - the modern corporation, the administrative bureaucracy, the global arms race - that most mirror the humanist vision for self-sovereignty while missing the emergent processes in which they are embedded. It’s as if the supremacist fantasy of total sovereignty were applied too literally by these nonhuman entities who, like a trope from The Office, act out an endless tragicomedy of \u003Cem>missing the point\u003C/em>. And what is the point? That the term is only meaningful in its process, immersed in what Weinbaum and Veitas call “a field of individuation,” the panorama of “ulterior individuations” that represent open pathways of recursive self-transcendence - the outer dark to the sovereign’s claim, the speculative open ended objects which present to the Enlightened I as “\u003Ca href=\"http://timothyquigley.net/vcs/berger-caravaggio.pdf\">darkness\u003C/a>, death, things which are not.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>Web3 is as much a product of game theory as it is of the cybernetic tradition and a radical critical framework sprung from the ontological shock of fucking with computers. It has successfully integrated a critical anthropology of money that may genuinely succeed in disarming the financial system, a de-politicized vision of the commons that has our most right libertarians comfortable citing Elinor Ostrom, and a free vision of information as democracy that questions core mainstream assumptions around authorship and intellectual possession. If we are to take on coordination problems at scale, we need to recognize the beast that is behind door number four - a kind of “Cartesian theater,” with irrational and fundamentally violent assumptions about the nature of being and the role of the human in it.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The Cartesian round is this hollow mirror play, trying to fog what we all know to be true: control requires static categories, and stasis is death. In our swarming organic world of intelligent creatures and crowds, bursting everywhere with change, this other Moloch is a kind of zombie life, an ultimate parasite. Hollowed out of the vivifying capacity for self-transcendence - even self-erasure, it loses all semblance of the organic, falls from the circle of life which is and always has been an embodied and applied project in pluralism.

The call to self-reflexive, practical pluralism asks that we internalize the psychedelic vacation, carry it over to the realm of design and ontological production.[8] That we develop disciplined procedures of ontological openness - what \u003Ca href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/designs-for-the-pluriverse\">Arturo Escobar\u003C/a> calls “mundane daily practices of interbeing” - encode rupture and becoming into our practice, and recognize that the stakes of our impulse against our own imperial nature are biblical in proportion.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The provocative premise of Fred Moten’s capstone text of black optimism, \u003Ca href=\"https://www.dukeupress.edu/the-universal-machine\">The Universal Machine\u003C/a>, is to pose a dark, open-ended underground to the Turing Machine of universal computability, the contagious energy of that which is exiled from the philosophies of presence. Quote Moten: “What we say must seem stupid to the regulators; the unbroken code of our enchanted, inkantatory refreshment of the paraontological totality—theorizing what it is to hold some land or what it is to be let to hold twenty dollars—is so much undercomputational nonsense to the ones who cannot see the con/sensual, contrarational beauty of blackness, the universal machine.” Coordination is a righteous lens, and many pressing issues of our time argue for it well. But it contains the risk that our work will remain a matter of mere reaction.

We are partial to the double entendre of _state_ as a term for a kind of legitimized domination and as a technology of memory. So why such brazen cooptation? We resented the collapse of these signifiers into a tool of white claw supremacy, the preferential liberty of those who own boats and planes.\n\nMaybe it was the mushrooms - or maybe it’s because we are in fact always reading Deleuze & Guattari - but we looked to _[A Thousand Plateaus](https://files.libcom.org/files/A%20Thousand%20Plateaus.pdf)_ for some memetic ammunition. The term “rhizome state” was briefly considered. It had flavors of the infinite game, of a properly subversive view of networks as underground, cutting across boundaries - adventitious free association, nonlinear and opportunistic viral synergy.\n\nYou see, we had just dropped the first volume of the collaborative journal _[Inverted City](https://x.com/EthForestDAO/status/1766229291082387659?s=20)_ and we were excited at the volume’s overarching concept of urban centers as mechanisms of capture resistance. Too complex to be controlled, too many corridors and guerrilla avenues of resistance or flight, we envisioned the city as an analogue node in a digital anticapture apparatus. With its cybernetic and subversive street memory, its messy and organic calling up of all the elements of a world to produce a manic novelty, _the city already was a_ _network state_.\n\nNevertheless, the concept passed. There is a crowd within us (“_there’s a lodger in me, larger than me_”), and it will do this task better. Josh rolled a joint, someone made a joke (“_they see branches, chains, rows, columns, dominoes, striae. Once in a while along the edges they discover a misshapen figure or a shaky contour_…”). Christy was reading in the backyard and the close Denver sun was shining just so. We shut the book and set out for the main event to see if we could score a Filecoin t-shirt.\n\n---\n\nOut of all the night events, the Hats Protocol party at Blind Tiger (co-hosted by Cabin and Coordinape) was really the best. Maybe it’s because it takes a certain type to see how discretely radical and transformative the Hats and Coordinape protocols are as _network technologies_, but we found ourselves chest to chest in a web of ecosystem alignment, witnessing a phenomenon of contagion as baked and half-baked concepts of mutualism, lateral shoots of subversive coordination and avant-garde democracy swept through the crowd as if through fertile soil. In the chthonic haze I saw the network, usually scattered across the globe, held together now by systolic pressure, the contracted heart of a buried acéphale.\n\nAcéphale, the Headless. If we look at Stafford Beer’s [Viable Systems Model](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Viable_Systems_Model), we find an apparent instrumental hierarchy: operations, coordination, control, intelligence, policy - the head at the top (policy), dolling out nested sub-functions, operations that are held captive to the grand design. Hats and Coordinape both identify the system rather as a network, with mere pressure points (control, intelligence, policy), prone to capture and runaway hierarchy, but not determined by them. These loci of signal retention are always in danger of sprouting into Heads, the authoritarian mysticism of the Face, but a well managed network body can stave off facialization and keep them as hyphae, collective signal receivers. (“…_sometimes, to the extent that it performs a veritable \"defacialization,\" it frees something like probe-heads {fetes chercheuses, guidance devices)”)._ Give-tokens, not judgments; Hats, not heads.\n\nThis sci-fi collective, cohered beneath unrealistic opinions about [what a social body can do](https://deleuze.cla.purdue.edu/lecture/lecture-02/), probe heads swimming in this common-pool soil of logics both [mycelial](https://greenpill.network/pdf/mycofi.pdf) and [mathematical](https://www.wtfisqf.com/). The tools we build are a staving off of judgment. Technologies for keeping the aperture open. Our shifting self-identity, our State, is a condition of openness to the [outside](https://zora.co/collect/oeth:0x2d17e1c913a616e30ff267afda30a69d9ad25343).\n\n---\n\n> ### _Beyond the face lies an altogether different inhumanity: no longer that of the primitive head, but of \"probe-heads\"; here, cutting edges of deterritorialization become operative and lines of deterritorialization positive and absolute, forming strange new becomings, new polyvocalities. Become clandestine, make rhizome everywhere, for the wonder of a nonhuman life to be created. Face, my love, you have finally become a probe-head..._\n\n---\n\nThe “nomad state” was the second term we considered. The problem here was that the figure of the digital nomad was the exact opposite of what we were trying to convey; being localists, we knew that the tourist channels that circumvent the globe are great sources of extraction, inequity and environmental destruction. The nomad-tourist is always wanting to _see_ something new, to engage in spectacle.\n\nDeleuze and Guattari’s nomad, modeled after the Scythian nomad of the Eurasian steppe, occasions a distinction between two types of vision, two types of inhabiting the world: _optical_and _haptic_. In _optic_ vision is the much maligned [Western gaze](https://monoskop.org/images/4/4e/Said_Edward_Orientalism_1979.pdf), that sterile and metaphysically cautious prequel to capture. Optic vision is binary: _di_-vision - boundary, hierarchy, the panic of so many fragmented consumers who would stumble through life discrediting the entanglements that become them while they rush toward an idealized Entanglement that could calm the nightmare. They see without seeing, and this projected vacancy scales en masse to amount to a collective scorched earth policy (commercialism, colonialism, whatever).\n\n_Haptic_ is another word for touch, the tactile sense. One sees with reciprocity, one puts oneself at stake, crosses the wall of fear to inhabit the _earth_ (as opposed to the World) - unidealized. It’s this risk, this vulnerability of embodiment, the open and welcomed potential for entanglement and transfiguration, and ultimately also the networked quality of haptic inhabitation, haptic travel, that we intended to convey. This haptic nomad doesn’t cut square lines into stone, but follows its mineral signals, investigating its singularities, reading its embeddedness and appreciating its elemental memory. (_A stone is a network state_.)\n\nThe haptic, they claim, is related to smooth space, an esoteric concept you don’t need to know to find resonance with the jumbled conversations of skyward possibility that animate our commons-oriented probe network. In haptic sight, “no line separates earth from sky, which are of the same substance; there is neither horizon nor background nor perspective nor limit nor outline or form nor center; there is no intermediary distance, or all distance is intermediary…. This reversal of the laws of gravity turns _lack of direction_ and negation of volume into constructive forces… It is an absolute that is one with becoming itself, with process. It is the absolute of passage, which in nomad art merges with its manifestation.”\n\nClearly this “_nomad state”_ meme wasn’t going to do, unless the entire ecosystem was on psilocybin (all at once? Honestly might be doable). Nonetheless. _Process merged with manifestation_. It was the next day at the Metagov brunch that Michael Zargham told me, “Blockchain is just durable prefiguration.”\n\n---\n\nThe public goods space - or whatever you want to call the contingent of crypto that is dedicated to exploratory commons infrastructure, experimental and pluralistic deployments of ethical market frameworks, widespread and uncompromising political _as well as economic_democracy - is like a great prefigurative body, and these brunches and parties are part of its metabolism. I shared a bowl of blueberries with Jeff Emmett while discussing mycelial finance. We’ll go on to set up a conviction voting experiment with [Fun DAO](https://etherealforest.org/blog/2024-01-30-build-your-own-fun-dao/). (“I am all filament. Let every inspiration of democracy shake me, let the hyphae cloud of the participatory earth press to my ribs.”)\n\nThe ideas propagate and elaborate out, cosmolocally, based in this haptic incidence, the discrete life of this skin. Josh blurts out with a kind of strange assurance: _the machinery is in place. We’re locked in_.\n\nSo, we put a lot of idle energy into coming up with competing memes to the network state. The rhizome state, the nomad state. It wasn’t until that Saturday afternoon, hitting a joint outside the Regen event and entering to hear Gregory Landua talk about the life and death of a regenerative dream that I came to cognize the issue not with my mind but with my body. Haptic sight. And a strange calm came over me.\n\nMaybe another meme wasn’t the thing we needed to defeat the network state. Instead, feel the metabolism. The prefigurative faith in a distributed swarm of dreamers working together as one machine body, producing the future: _**Network**_. The conviction that our orgs and our initiatives may die a million deaths, but the collective memory of a more just and free future is ineradicable: _**State**_.\n\nDemocracy is a prolix method, wrote the late Toni Negri. The participatory project our machinic body strives for is an endless regress. We, at our AirBnB’s and Kombucha bars, have barely begun the game. “A machinic assemblage is a dynamic composition of heterogenous elements that eschew identity but nonetheless function together, subjectively, socially, in cooperation.” Inhale: The divide has been shattered. We’re sure in our project, regeneration, freedom, the open society, the singularity of the individual compounded and enhanced by the commons, animate force under the sun whose membership is total. Exhale: Our network, hazy eyes on that shifting horizon, has to focus on what’s furthest away, bridge the uncommon and investigate our exterior, be vulnerable to it, see with haptic eyes.","src/content/essays/Haptic Vision & Network State at ETHDenver.md","34c5a962a84b18d9",{"html":161,"metadata":162},"\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>As the ordeal went on, it became clear to certain of these balloonists, observing from above and poised ever upon a cusp of mortal danger, how much the modern State depended for its survival on maintaining a condition of \u003Cem>permanent siege\u003C/em>—through the systematic encirclement of populations, the starvation of bodies and spirits, the relentless degradation of civility until citizen was turned against citizen, even to the point of committing atrocities… When the sieges ended, the balloonists chose to fly on, free now of the political delusions that reigned more than ever on the ground, pledged solemnly only to one another, proceeding as if under a world-wide, never-ending state of siege.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thomas Pynchon, \u003Cem>Against the Day\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>My roots go down to the depths of the world, through earth dry with brick, and damp earth, through veins of lead and silver.

It’s this risk, this vulnerability of embodiment, the open and welcomed potential for entanglement and transfiguration, and ultimately also the networked quality of haptic inhabitation, haptic travel, that we intended to convey.

Exactly when is unclear, but\nthe Facebook post from whoever runs the account of Berkeley\nCastle (the site of many intrigues and conspiracies of British\nRoyal History) tells the story of an unlucky character that they\nclaim won the mantle, there at the dawn of Modernity, as the\nlast jester. “The last court jester in England was Dicky Pearce\n(sic) he was the Earl of Suffolk’s fool, born in 1665 he eventu-\nally entered the service of the Berkeley family here at Berkeley\ncastle... In 1728 during a performance he overbalanced from\nthe minstrels gallery in the Great Hall and fell to his death.”\nThe entry ends with a hint of mystery: “The question has been\nraised - did he fall or was he pushed he had apparently made\nfun of one of Lord Berkeley’s guests who had taken offence,\nthe truth will never be known.”\n\nOn January 3rd, 2009, the genesis block of bitcoin was mined.\nIn the context of a banking crisis that laid bare the self-serving\ncollusion and callous extraction behind the Western financial\nsystems’ facade of credible neutrality, bitcoin asked the ques-\ntion: could we construct belief network effects without hier-\narchies? Could we erase the parlors of collusion, the adminis-\ntrative bloating, the white supremacy and the war games and\nuse programming code and mathematical laws to construct a\nnoncoercive, networked legitimacy - a scalable thermodynamic\nargument of credibility?\n\nThere remains the question of what forces and actions caused\nthis crisis (who killed the jester?). Its unwinding will probably\ntake decades, if there are still such things [1]. We’re network\nphilosophers, not economists or anthropologists - or economic\napologists, for that matter - so please allow us the liberty of\nan abstract provocation over a direct answer: The bankers, the\nregulators, the politicians all fucked up, got too greedy and\nshowed their (weird, cosmologically perverse) cards. Their\narguments of legitimacy by process, performance, credible\nneutrality, etc, were crowded over by the archaic, magical belief\nsystem that cradles them, a millennia-old doctrine of mystical\nsupremacy that uses symbol and psyche to give incidental\npower the claim of Divine Right. It’s even possible that this\ntemporary unveiling was deliberate, a taunting message to\nthe crowds meant to say: What are you gonna do? There is no\nother way.\n\nOf course, if that’s the case then they really fucked up. **There is\nanother way.**\n\nIt was also in 2009 that the not particularly notable UK\nacademic journal _Biology Direct_ published “Trees and networks\nbefore and after Darwin,” a work of disciplinary historiography\nthat journeyed down the rabbit hole of 400 years of West-\nern scientific cosmology. In it, Mark Ragan shows how the\ndominant discourse around nature before the 19th century was\nframed within an Emanationist system:\n\n\n“ *Emanationist describes unitary philosophical or cos-*\n*mological systems according to which all that exists (the*\n*universe and everything within it) has arisen through*\n*a process of flowing-out from, and willed by, a deity or*\n*First Principle. This flowing-out necessarily gives rise*\n*to a hierarchy or continuum of entities of which those*\n*closest to the First Principle are the most-perfect, while*\n*those farther away are increasingly material, embodied*\n*and imperfect*.”\n\nSuffice to say that the metaphysical assumptions about who\nhas “greater or lesser being” have justified all number of\nhumanitarian and environmental cruelties. While this frame\nof nature was favored by the majority until the 19th century\nlargely because of this political and colonial instrumental-\nization - there were those heretics who held the belief that the\ngenetic powers of nature arise from the interaction of parts in a\nnetwork, a phenomenon we know today as _emergence_.\n\nAs an example of early disruptions to this “Great Chain of\nBeing” among the natural scientists, Ragan cites Carl Linnae-\nus, Swedish botanist and author of the _Philosophia Botanica_.\n“Although at first Linnaeus accepted that nature is ordered in\na linear scale, by 1750 or 1751 he realized that even the plants\ncould not be arranged in a simple unitary continuum.” Quote\nthe Philosophia Botanica: “This is the first and last desider-\natum in botanical study. Nature does not make leaps. All plants\nshow affinities on either side, like territories in a geographical\nmap.” (We love this.) Going further, the Italian botanist Vi-\ntaliano Donati writes in his 1750 _Della storia naturale marina\ndell ’Adriatico_ :\n\n“*When I observe the productions of Nature, I do not*\n*see one single and simple progression, or chain of*\n*beings, but rather I find a great number of uniform,*\n*perpetual and constant progressions. In each one of*\n*those orders, or Classes, nature forms its series and*\n*presents its almost imperceptible passages from link to*\n*link in its chains. In addition, the links of the chain are*\n*joined (uniti) in such a way within the links of another*\n*chain, that the natural progressions should have to be*\n*compared more to a net (rete) than to a chain, that net*\n*being, so to speak, woven with various threads which*\n*show, between them, changing communications, con-*\n*nections, and unions*.”\n\nAffinities, nets, and a denigrated chain of being. The powers\nof creation democratized, relationalized. Natural observation\nwell before Darwin was realizing an alternative, an Other\nway, to the great dismay of their fascist - ahem, Emanationist\ncounterparts. And yes, reader, this metaphysical drama plays\nout today: in our cultural reception of science, our discourses\naround economy and warfare, more subtly in cults both reli-\ngious and commercial, and, we argue, in the range of possible\norganizational forms that cryptoeconomic DAOs have recently\ninfiltrated.\n\nSure, there are resources we could cite that trace New York\nand Boston banking families to Emanationist cults and secret\nsocieties, traditions that go back to English Royal bids against\nthe hegemony of the universal Catholic state, to Queen Eliza-\nbeth’s magician-advisor John Dee and the colonial projects his\noccult beliefs incited. Genuine-article practices of Christian\nritual magic invoked by racist colonizers on both sides of the\nAtlantic, the kind of magic realm of kitsch cosmic patriarchy\nand stock Greco-Roman statues fit for a Disney movie [2]. We\ncould cite these traditions, but that would be to miss the point.\nThe Emanationist mode is more anonymous than any single\nconspiracy - it need not directly touch the tradition to carry its\nimperious mantle.\n\nThe nation-state, the commercial brand - any cult of power\nor charismatic leadership manifests it, this top-down fallacy\nof genetic power. We call this mode, this last hold off of the\nmystical Emanationist philosophy, **_Control_**.\n\nWe call the Emanationist strategy of categorizing individuals\nwithin the lower hierarchies, under an artificially constitut-\ned lack of direct access to genetic power, **_Interiorization_** or\n_Enclosure_.\n\nWe call the field of network relations - the playground of\naffinity and experiment where the composable surface area of\nbodies have direct access to the dynamic powers of emergence,\nwithout an interlocutor - the **_Exterior_**.\n\n\n## The Friends of Control\n\nThe friends of Control are everywhere. Like the electric buzz\nin the air before a lightning strike, there they are, barely\nsensible but saturating everything with their presence. The\nclaustrophobic air of enclosure, interiority: aggravated po-\nlarities, axioms of tension and delusion, sweaty ideologies of\nfailure and self-loathing. _This whole field is stuffed, this festival is\nall the way fucking inside_. That’s the spirit of the interior, power\nvacuum artificially kept from the pirate outside. Infantilization,\ncomplacency, total atrophy of self-governance capacities, the\nmuscle tendons of network power diminished, the occult spell\nthat holds relationality hostage.\n\nHere’s a counterspell, a mantra of the infinite (and the infinite\nrelation): **There is no such thing as an interior, whatever they\nsay - it’s all dripping with Outside, every molecule, every\natom.**\n\n**Axiom #1:** _Power is relational, immanent within the network of\nrelations; All power is network power. Control Organizations are\nconstructed from a magical (Emanationist) suspension of this law._\n\nA Control Organization is composed of two parts: a **protocol**,\nthe set of repeated behaviors and cultural codes that make up\nthe coordinated action of the org, and a **ban** - the mystified\nwithholding or hoarding of access to the relational elements\nthat animate the protocol.\n\nRigid structural hierarchies are naturally vulnerable to mutiny,\nexit and reform. They break down when there isn’t a logic of\nforce, an assumed threat of violence or capture. This is where\nmetaphysics comes in, the ultimate soft power, the presti-\ndigitation that offsets the relationship of force to a magical\na priori [3]. While Control does sometimes indulge in explicit\nviolence, it must ultimately depend on a premise of interiority\nthat is magical or anti-material, a mysticism of power that cir-\ncumvents the use of force entirely. The administrative elite like\na priest class, shuffling papers and metaphysical presumptions,\nimaginary origin stories, reflections of your own local godhead.\nThe ban.\n\nThe members are less complicit than complacent, seduced by\nthe ever growing object-at-hand. This is Control’s narcotic\nblanket - an unvarnished task in the imagined vacuum state,\nthe pure logic of hierarchical necessity. Withdrawn from the\nbroader field of relations, that netherworld is comfortable\nfor all its disempowerment, but also for all of its perceived\nsafety [4]. Exteriority penetrates the interior all the way through,\nof course - the withdrawal is always a facade - but this is a\nscandal of genesis, a state secret. There are whole departments\ndedicated to suppressing it. (Imagine the company man’s\nterror at the realization that it was always his power – and his\nresponsibility.)\n\nThis is the riddle of capacity in Control. There are varying\ntypes of orgs - negatively or positively determined, more rigid\nor more open, offensive or defensive, usurper or fortress, but\nthey only describe the style of the protocol. Control organiza-\ntion, Control as such, is a dead term in a category of its own,\na film of propaganda that overlays but never touches the real\ngenerative power of networks. It is constantly having to call to\nbear outside resources (even resources with which to conceal\nthe calling). **Control can only be this matter of managing\nexternal resources, none are its own.**\n\nExteriority in these settings is presented as a gift from god, a\nscarcity. _Strait is the gate,_ they say, _and narrow is the way, that\nleadeth unto life, and few there be that find it_. Infinity strapped\ndown into a petty moral video game, a grand mythos of dearth.\nAll of your outsides are our inside. _Only by way of us_. Central-\nized organizations can be more or less dictated by this mantra,\nwith greater or lesser windows of exteriority - the Rapunzel’s\ntower of the astrophysics professor regards a huge panorama.\nBut Control is nonetheless their mode, this sleight of hand\naround capturing exteriority, bringing it in, concealing the\nsource, the alleged ‘strait gate.’\n\nA centralized organization becomes a Control Organization\nwhen it institutes this mystical ban, the magical notion of\npower instituted from within: today the brand, the soul, blood\nor soil, the (supposed) innate righteousness of a transcendent\nterm - in another time the divine right of kings [5]. It’s this\nattitude of antirealism and mystification on the inside that\ncorrelates to so much psychotic behavior on the outside. Of\ncourse, the cumulative power of the substrates, the avenues of\ndissent they embody is a huge threat to the friends of Control.\nThe “mystical ban” can be thought of as a ban on the Substrate,\nthe knowledge of its generative power and its right to exit. But\nmore on this later.\n\nIt’s important to note that, while not all centralized organi-\nzations are Control Organizations, all Control Organizations\nare centralized organizations. If the goal of an organization is\nto resist Control, from an outside agent but also from within,\nit will decentralize, suspending the ban and opening up access\nto the protocol. It crosses a threshold where the previously\nmystified gate to exteriority is laid bare, banished, and the\nExterior comes rushing in. Decentralized ranks, permissionless\ninclusion, guerrilla protocols of action in place of direction, an\nopen breeze: think of the French Resistance.\n\nThe Decentralized Autonomous Organizations now ascen-\ndant in the web3 space are a special case in this landscape,\ndistinct from simple decentralized organizations by virtue\nof their embeddedness in the substrates - in this case, the\ninformal communities of gamers, financial system-dissidents\nand especially the open source & free software engineers from\nwhich the crypto space initially emerged [6] , as well as the degens\nand radicals that animated its expansion. DAOs can be more\nor less centralized, but because of this greater fealty, they are\nanathema to Control [7].\n\nIn this case, the organization cedes territorial claim; jettisoning\nthe ban, it becomes an enemy of Control, it has **_deterritorial-\nized_**.\n\n**The DAO form represents, sooner or**\n**later,** **_the death of the ban_****.\n\nRagequit, forks, audits, sleuths: their innate relationship to the\nsubstrates forfeits the ban in toto; they can restrict the outside,\nstrategically (protocol), but they cannot conceal it [8].\n\n**The DAO form represents, sooner or later,** **_the death of the\nban_****.** It demystifies and makes available the _selective_ value of\ninteriorization (as an interim strategy rather than a mythos\nof supremacy) by defanging it of its greatest weapon: formal\nor ideological enclosure. Fused with the Substrate, the DAO\nis a kind of social recapitulation of the “protocol-app” format.\nThe superorganisms of a given substrate - and the Substrate\nbeneath it - maintain in their informal life a “true north” for\nit to follow, a sublime layer that makes death and fracture a\nlife again. What we have left is a design horizon that says\n“networks first” - external relations first always - not as a moral\ndirective but as an act of realism. Bruno Latour’s actor-net-\nwork theory.\n\n\n```\n“O the insideness of it all! It’s as if we’ve lost\nall access to the Exterior, the unbounded, the\ninfinite - for all its Vital Mysteries.”\n```\n```\n“But wasn’t that our intent?” trolled the\nSubstrate. “Enclosure of our selves and our\nmilieus, so that we may halt our own advance\nupon the full potential of our becoming; out of\nfear that, if empowered, unleashed, it would\ninvoke an unimaginably infinite cosmic death\nof all things that are, or could be?”\n\n\n“Is that what lays behind these sprite walls?_\nNot life, but a kind of death? I knew it.”\n\n\n“Your cosmos drips with meager life, mine\nwith flux and death spatter. In the starling\ncircuitboard, call me *katabasis*!”\n```\n\n## What is a Substrate?\n\n**Axiom #2:** _Substrates are inherently resistant to Control: central-\nized or decentralized, the closer a relationship an organization has\nwith a substrate - and the more it becomes aware of and optimizes\naround this relationship - the more resistant it is to the Con-\ntrol-function, the mythos of the ban._\n\nTechnologies exist within, and are determined by, fields of\nrelations - a hammer is a weapon, a tool, a piece of art, etc. In\nthe case of DAOs, we can see that their design features are\ncontingent upon the field of relations that surround them.\nWhen we transform the operative function of the individual -\nusing for example S BTs, Gitcoin-style passports, or in a more\nexotic case the terra0 thought experiment - we give the DAO\nform a rich spectrum of new capacities. Similarly, there are\ninformal communities, sometimes known as memetic commu-\nnities or ecosystems - though here we will call them **substrates**\nto emphasize their potency - that may present new network\nfeatures to the DAO, new possibilities for activation, power\nprinciples with which we can engage and determine the birth,\nlife and afterlife of a DAO.\n\nSubstrates are permissionless, spontaneous, loosely bound\nnetworks constructed around a recursive [9] identity, a vague and\nshifting center continuously emergent from the reciprocal\nbehavior of a network itself. In other words, **they have no walls\nand they continuously build the ground they stand on**. ( _“A fu-\ngitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the earth.”_ ) Why so much\n_vagueness_? Because this type of (pseudo)organization- to use\na cliche, lives on the edge, identifying any limit as a synthesis,\na point of contact, an opportunity of anticapture and a way to\nshed dead skin [10].\n\nVivified at the borderland, this form has a kind of mania for\ncontact, letting itself be overtaken. An organization or an\nindividual (Control or otherwise) may have selective external\noperations and engagements, but for a substrate, like a hyper-\nsphere, every bit of its inside is paved over with exteriority. A\nsuperabundance of relations, of the principle of relation. _Small\nis the gate, wide is the way._\n\nTo formalize slightly further, a **substrate** is:\n\n* **a permissionless, often spontaneous and**\n**shifting assemblage of identity affiliation that**\n**functions as a locus of reciprocity; or,**\n* **a memetic community that holds informal**\n**protocols of mutual aid; or,**\n* **a Control Organization’s pure “deterritori-**\n**alized” counterpart; or,**\n* **a social network composed entirely of soft**\n**bonds (memes, lore, storytelling) and arrows**\n**of indeterminacy that subsume those bonds,**\n\nThe scientific definition works as well, here:\n\n***the surface or material on or from which an organism lives,***\n***grows, or obtains its nourishment.***\n\nWe address this network-form in order to call attention to two\nthings: first, the way that it animates the fugitive life of DAOs,\nmaintains an open surface area of relation that is anathema\nto the cult of power that dictates Control Organizations[11].\nSecond, the extent to which substrates may represent design\nhorizons, potential paths of hybridization or clear subsump-\ntion that might keep capture at the gate. Let no one doubt the\nnecessity of organizations that hold the Substrate up as a guide\nas they stand against those led by the occult metaphysics of\ncorporate or state-centric bodies. If we’re going to survive, we\nhave to reclaim the toolbox. This means situating the tools in a\nnetwork that’s too robust for narrative capture.\n\nOrganizations and the substrate are two forms, but in their\nembodied lives they will always be subject to the spectrum \nthe adulterations, compromises, alliances, solutions and\ndissolutions that animate realist networks. These are the exotic,\nmonstrous network entities that the forms truly exist for\n(there is no pure organization, no true substrate, no zero point\nof network pollution, nor would we want one). The concepts\nthemselves should be subjugated to the renewed capacities that\ncan be unlocked by the exploration they incite. In some cases a\nsubstrate may resist capture by taking on the form of a DAO.\nIn others, a DAO flees by way of dissolution into a new meme,\na substrate’s moving target, accretion along a deterritorializing\nslope. There may be unforeseeable mutations of either form,\nthe secret abstract machines, attractors that lock you in – the\ntruth to come is always the present’s hybrid. The purity of the\nconcept says nothing of its life as a tool.\n\nFor the purposes of this piece, you can think of “substrate” as\na formalization of the phenomenon of ecosystems or memetic\ncommunities. (To formalize, to be clear, is not to institu-\ntionalize; on the contrary, the purpose of this document is\nto clarify a non-institutional form and name it as a tool and\nally of anticapture). The decentralization hypothesis is not a\nbinary. Rather than recommending a particular design-form, it\nattacks the metaphysical premise that seeks to keep one form\nstatic and sanctioned by god. Centralized or decentralized,\nwhat matters is the substrate. **Once you’ve disarmed all of the\nauthoritarian chimeras, illuminated the way to the exit, you’ve\nwon by the gesture alone.**\n\n\n\n## Design Horizons\n\nThe DAO’s denial of the ban is a defiant first act, breaking\nout of the chain of being ( God - heaven - nation - sovereign\nsoul ) and replacing it with the field of infinite relations, the\nExterior. (If Control Organizations always pledge allegiance\nto some member of the magical chain, the substrates are\nsimilarly stubborn in their allegiance to the Exterior.) In the\ncase of Ethereum, the social layer trumps any technological\ngame theory on the level of apps and even protocols. The\nsubstrate that is sometimes called Layer 0 (or “Super Layer 0”)\nis guided by this intuition, more importantly this _faith_ which\ngives permission to the wild experimentation that animates the\nprotocol in the first place: **The exits that one can take in this\nworld are infinite.**\n\nBut this pact between DAO and Substrate, it seems to us, has\nlargely been subliminal. We feel its effects and its energies,\nwe’re irreverent with its charge, but we’ve yet to fully consider\nit, in its multiplicity, as a programmable feature of the web3\nstack. **What is needed is a strategic cognizance of the Exterior\nat large, the substrates that animate it, and the design paths\nan organization may take in its context.** We’ve defied the ban,\nbut now we must denigrate its image. What are the rhythms\nand milieus of the Exterior? How can we use them as a design\ncompass - to make sure we never again build in the image of\nthe inside?\n\nAs we move forward, we approach the specter of a “sweet\nspot” between the zone of substrates and the organization. The\nrumor of a so-called ‘body without organs’ that has located the\nappropriate, electrified mixture between deterritorialization\nand grounding. If we try to look it directly in the eye we’ll cer-\ntainly lose it. Just hush, and take note: we are coming around\nto something.\n\n**Axiom #3:** _Products drain the substrate. Branded and enclosed,\nthey harbor little interiors withdrawn from relation. Those organi-\nzations or institutions that want to flee capture while maintaining\ntheir structure can enter into symbiotic relationships with substrates\nby swearing off products and instead generating resources._\n\nLike the last anti-real object - some who have done away\ncompletely with the mystical traps of the “Chain of Being”\nnevertheless bow to the product and see it as a wellspring of\nfreedom. Naturally, the DAO space has a host of strategies for\nfending off this particular form of capture, not least of which\nare those developed in the wake of the extensive dual-licensing\nbattles of the free software movement. At our current moment,\ntoken launches are suffering by the weight of regulatory am-\nbiguity and predatory rugs. But all of this forgets one of their\nfirst proposed purposes: bootstrapping open source projects.\n\nThe output of an open source protocol, even its most conserva-\ntive form, is better described as a resource than a product. It is\nbuilt around an indeterminacy, an openness to public iteration\n(the word would be optimization, but this is what makes it\ndistinct: the riff or improvisation of process is its primary goal).\nIt should be obvious that this anti-teleological, resource-first\nbias is another result of those protocols of affiliation that\ndefine the Substrate (and likewise, those anti-corporate norms\nwhich regard the Exterior as the site of production against the\ngenius-worship and brand fetishism of Silicon Valley). Indeed,\nopen source production is a prime example of contemporary\nbest practices around substrate-first organization. But they\naren’t the only one.\n\nAs an example of a substrate, consider the genre community -\ntake, for example, Lovecraftian horror. There is no onboarding\nprocess, no membership fee, you simply pick up a pen and be-\ngin to write. The output’s conformity to various tropes - secret\nsocieties, alien gods, spacetime dislocations, etc - determines\nits proximity to the substrate’s illusive center (that writer who\nconforms perfectly will find she’s very much off center). As\nyou level up, you’ll find yourself navigating implicit roles of\nmutual support - someone in your network wrote a review of\nyour book, you’re going to shill their new anthology, one of\nthe authors in the anthology later writes an introduction to\nyour short story collection. Maybe you’ve found an intellectual\ncrush, a _friend_ , such is the intrigue of the network.\n\nGenres of course contain formal organizations like publishing\nhouses, magazines, but their position in the substrate is in no\nway primary, even to the extent that undue attempts to insti-\ntutionalize or brand an element of the genre will be met with\nwide resistance. In this way tropes are sheltered from capture\nand interiorization by substrates, mobilized like armies march-\ning under the banner of infinite relations and indeterminacy.\n(Next time you see a reddit upheaval over a Marvel movie, ask\nyourself: what spontaneous democracy is at work here – how\ncan I learn from its example?)\n\n**What hybrid beast can we conjure out of the**\n**ocean of exteriority, so that our organization**\n**can be mythless - no ban, no cult of power**\n**- even while we improvise on the immanent**\n**mystery of networks, on the Substrate?**\n\nSmall, independent publishing houses negotiate this land-\nscape wonderfully. Their institutional or organizational life is a\nnegligible second to their participation in the substrates. They\nare always folding, forking, reshifting, all the better to maintain\ncharge, to remain activated, to serve a particular substrate and\nthe creative process in general. The goal is to contribute to the\ngenre, to lay a new ground on which new tropes can be built,\niterated upon, indeterminacy and experimentation on wheels.\nThey are often misunderstood as failures, or bad business\nplans, as if something so petty as brand recognition or market\ndominance were ever a respectable goal to the process-maxis,\ncultural guerrillas who know that the delicate balance of free\nassociation should never be sacrificed to perpetuate a trivial\ntitle. Profit is how we survive, creativity is how we live.\n\nGenre scenes are powerful examples of substrates, but their\norganizational allies in the indie publishing world have a dis-\nadvantage to DAOs in their relationship to the extraction/con-\nsumption model. People speak ill of financialization, but the\nfinancial experiments undertaken in the DAO space give us an\nopportunity to have our cake and eat it too. That’s our experi-\nment isn’t it? The design horizon: **Can we build a hybrid form,\na company with no products- finance without extraction,\nhierarchy without Control, process without end? A soil with\nno god?** What hybrid beast can we conjure out of the ocean of\nexteriority, so that our organization can be mythless - no ban,\nno cult of power - even while we improvise on the immanent\nmystery of networks, on the Substrate?\n\nIt’s often been noted that, upon close enough examination, one\nfinds in any significant historical event (9/11, JFK, whatever) a\nbeguiling tangle of collusion, conspiracy and coincidence, the\nkind of synchrony that would obviously signal a conspiracy if\nit didn’t point to a host of mutually exclusive plots. Why is this\nthe case? Maybe it’s because, when it comes to aristocracy and\nthe mercantile elite, there’s only so many of them, and they all\ngo to the same country clubs. Maybe it’s because very powerful\nfigures tend to be themselves entangled in a crowded sediment\nof competing collusions. When the impactful event occurs,\nit would seem, it’s almost always an uncalculated accident of\nthese schemes, a moment of emergence. Trace the million\nstrands all you want, but the intentionality is disperse, the trig-\nger spontaneous, an accident of Control - a meta-conspiracy.\n\nThinking about substrates, we should remember Thomas Pyn-\nchon’s recommendation from the dictionary of collusion and\nmetaconspiracy that is _Gravity’s Rainbow_ , that we establish a\ncounterpoint to the ever-present figure of Them:\n\n```\n“Of course a They-system is necessary - but it’s only half the\nstory. For every They there ought to be a We. In our case\nthere is. Creative paranoia means developing at least as\nthorough a We-system as a They-system.”\n```\n**This is the Substrate: a We-system**. We stack and integrate\nour free associations, our network conspiracies, our open\ncreation of resources, our mutual aid and our paved and inter-\nsecting avenues of exit until we’ve generated a cloud of dissent,\npotent with emergent omens, potential accidents of freedom.\nWe make ourselves available through sheer density of commu-\nnicating nodes, to the eruption, spontaneous and anonymous,\nof **metapower**. \n\n\n## Conclusion: The Ongoing Finale\n\nThe goals of this piece were simultaneously conceptual and\npractical: to identify an important mechanism of capture resis-\ntance latent but not often spoken about in the DAO space, and\nto draw up some provocations of what it might be to lean into\nthat mechanism, to let it transform our image of organization\nmore radically than it already has. But also, to elaborate upon\na metaphysical disposition common in (maybe responsible\nfor) the larger world of commercial capitalism that the DAO\nspace - for reasons libertarian and commonist, hacker ethical\nand mathe-puritanical - has been engaged with in a subliminal\nbattle from its outset. It’s a battle about realism and delusion,\nthe actual mystery of empiricism and emergence against the\nmystification of enclosed divinity.\n\nIn the end, the three points amount to a provocation upon the\npotential of an ethos of **metastability** in the DAO space. The\npremise that, in this atmosphere of innovation and denigra-\ntion of the mythologies of power, we can design a system\nthat is neither 0 nor 1, neither substrate or organization, but\nsuperposed and potent with both capacities. To quote the\nrenegade thinker Gilbert Simondon, how can we construct an\norg whose ontological premise is as **“a being** **_of_** **relation not a\nbeing** **_in_** **relation”**?\n\nHave you vanquished yourself of the ideal, and prepared for the\nrabid experimentalism of the adventure - prepared to go outside,\nto the Exterior?\n\nIt would seem, in the revolution of non-coercive thermody-\nnamic legitimacy that is blockchain, that the abstract stories\nwe tell ourselves, the final remaining mythologies of purity and\ncompletion, are the single barrier to our seeing the whole game\nboard as negotiations, mixtures, network forms - _communica-\ntions, connections, and unions_ (Donati). How far can we take\nit, this epochal demystification? Huge gains can be made by\nshifting our primary focus from the limited frames of reference\navailable to us as agents imprisoned by bounded territories,\ncontrol orgs, the Friends of Control, to the substrates, death\nretentive and enlivened with network power, the godless un-\nsteadiness, the premonition of a peak relationality.\n\n\nYou have your pure forms - Substrate, Organization, the\neverlasting specter of Control, but as you’re riding the scales\nbetween them, which direction you’re going is defined by\nthe relation to identity. Is your identity changing with the\nmovements of the current - or is it stubbornly remaining\nstatic? Beasts of idle complacency, the organizational hollow\nstates are free grabs for psychopaths and the agents of Control.\nHave you vanquished yourself of the ideal, and prepared for\nthe rabid experimentalism of the adventure - prepared to go\noutside, to the Exterior?\n\nIt’s not a matter of one organizational form or another being \ncorrect or pure. The situational adequacy is a moving target, a\nzone of practical sufficiency, the tool that is right for the job.\nIn most cases, this is what should be strived for, this is what\nwill do. Much more difficult is locating the machinic point, a\n_peak adequacy_ (sometimes called “the zone” or “flow state”), the\nillusive, antidivine moment that can only be prepared for, never\ncreated. The crowned product of a mania of different exper-\niments; transformations, dissolutions, alliances, ego-deaths.\nHere, in the _jouissance dans l ’infini_ , scale breaks down and all\nthe atoms of your assemblage become activated, everything is\nbeing made use of. Autogenesis, the infinite fork, _Brahman_.\n\n### Notes\n\n[1] For a good start, you might try Colin Drumm’s dissertation The\nDifference that Money Makes: Sovereignty, Indecision and the Politics of\nLiquidity.\n\n[2] Kenny Glosch’s Parapower Mapping pod is the place to look if you\nwant to engage this particular rabbit hole.\n\n[3] By “magical” here we are talking about a rhetoric that employs allusions\nto supernatural, unreal forces (e.g. “white supremacy”) to ends of mystifi-\ncation or propaganda. There are of course natural scientists outside of the\npurview of the academy that are practicing important work they themselves\nrefer to as “magick”, but these are naturalist rather than supernatural pro-\ngrammes in our book (e.g. Peter J Carroll).\n\n[4] It should be said that this mythology of an internal life of an organi-\nzation or organism is a feature of Control that is propagated across scales,\nfrom the nation-state to the individual, and perhaps beneath. We can’t\nhelp but wonder what state religions and chemical popes restrict the basal\ndreams of metazoa...\n\n[5] Today, just maybe, what we need is a mysticism of networks.\n\n[6] ‘Especially’ because it’s unclear whether protocols for permission-\nlessness and against IP would have been embedded if not for influence\n(again, won by the work of a metastable many) of Richard Stallman, Eric\nRaymond, etc. For reflections on how radical this movement was, check\nout Chris Kelty’s book Two Bits: On the Cultural Significance of Free\nSoftware.\n\n[7] DAOs that do not foreground a healthy culture of forking and ragequit\nare not DAOs.\n\n[8] To the extent that a DAO may be led by a ‘benevolent dictator’, their\npower can only be interim, under constant threat from its decentralized\nmembership, if not from the wider cultural expanse that can check its\npower through sheer force of alternatives. If a DAO develops the kind\nof ideological closure that tries to generate sentimental or impractically\nego-bound relationships with such figures – the beginnings of cult - it has\nthe threat of a fork. Under these new conditions, contingent hierarchies are\nliberated from their metaphysics, demystified to become just another tool.\n\n[9] Ibid on Kelty, especially passages on “recursive publics” in FOSS.\n\n[10] “OK, how can we extract ourselves, at the same time, from a struc-\nturalist vision that seeks correspondences, analogies, and homologies, and\nfrom a Marxist vision that seeks determinants.

While this frame\nof nature was favored by the majority until the 19th century\nlargely because of this political and colonial instrumental-\nization - there were those heretics who held the belief that the\ngenetic powers of nature arise from the interaction of parts in a\nnetwork, a phenomenon we know today as \u003Cem>emergence\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As an example of early disruptions to this “Great Chain of\nBeing” among the natural scientists, Ragan cites Carl Linnae-\nus, Swedish botanist and author of the \u003Cem>Philosophia Botanica\u003C/em>.\n“Although at first Linnaeus accepted that nature is ordered in\na linear scale, by 1750 or 1751 he realized that even the plants\ncould not be arranged in a simple unitary continuum.” Quote\nthe Philosophia Botanica: “This is the first and last desider-\natum in botanical study. Nature does not make leaps. All plants\nshow affinities on either side, like territories in a geographical\nmap.” (We love this.)

While Control does sometimes indulge in explicit\nviolence, it must ultimately depend on a premise of interiority\nthat is magical or anti-material, a mysticism of power that cir-\ncumvents the use of force entirely.

If the goal of an organization is\nto resist Control, from an outside agent but also from within,\nit will decentralize, suspending the ban and opening up access\nto the protocol. It crosses a threshold where the previously\nmystified gate to exteriority is laid bare, banished, and the\nExterior comes rushing in.

It is\nbuilt around an indeterminacy, an openness to public iteration\n(the word would be optimization, but this is what makes it\ndistinct: the riff or improvisation of process is its primary goal).\nIt should be obvious that this anti-teleological, resource-first\nbias is another result of those protocols of affiliation that\ndefine the Substrate (and likewise, those anti-corporate norms\nwhich regard the Exterior as the site of production against the\ngenius-worship and brand fetishism of Silicon Valley).

NourbeSe Philip), _Black and Blur_**\n\n### Aesthetics\n\n**A**esthetics, vibes, intersubjective atmosphere may seem like externalities, inconsequential surplus to the “real world” of finance and institutions. But this is only sleight of hand, a distortion of the diffuse, field-like character of power and empowerment. Power (politics), in its relationality, is nothing less than this matter of feeling. The philosopher of technology Bernard Stiegler opens his _Symbolic Misery: vol 1 The Hyperindustrial Epoch_ (2014) with the following: “The question of politics _is a question of aesthetics_… I use the word aesthetics here in its widest sense, where _aisthēsis_ means sensory perception, and where the question of aesthetics is, therefore, that of feeling and sensibility in general.”\n\nThe object of this piece is the way that aesthetics relate to regimes of structural violence, and the way crypto might fundamentally intervene in and subvert the hegemony of those regimes. In the distributed ledger, we may have the germ of a culture of aesthetic autonomy and free association without limit, coordinating infrastructure unburdened by the pall of coercive relations. Beyond the feeling of administrative bureaucracy, the atmospheric, oh so-subtle implication of violence that permeates the legally sanctioned institutions, we are on the verge of discovering [legitimacy](https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html) by other means. And when we get to the party, having climbed the plateaus, to reach the plain of an unaccountable and unadministered population, the protocol underground will be there waiting for us.\n\n### Undergrounds\n\nUndergrounds are political. The first use of the term in the sense of “clandestine cultural behaviors” [1] is attached to the American underground railroad, escape routes from the South. The origins of that phrase are disputed: a 1839 newspaper article quoting a young slave who imagined a magical “railroad that goes underground all the way to Boston,” or words elsewhere, around the same time, referencing slave catchers who, having lost the trail, said that \"there must be an underground railroad somewhere.”\n\nIt was first used to refer to subcultures in the early 50’s, fresh off of the memories of the underground media and military campaigns of the French Resistance. At the time, of course, obscenity laws and rigid conformity in the United States meant that alternative aesthetic movements faced repression that rivaled that of Vichy France. If the atmospheres of secret queer gathering places, multi-racial jazz shows and beatnik drug dens didn’t quite have a militant air to them, the codes and protocols established to protect them were as elaborate as those used to evade the Sicherheitsdienst.\n\n(Riddle: what kind of knowledge is both freely available and deeply secret?)\n\nUndergrounds are political, and politics is a question of aesthetics - sensible communities, intersubjective atmospheres, _vibes_.\n\nStiegler will go on to argue that the dominant “sensible community” of today is “entirely fabricated” by technologies of control: “it has become a matter of controlling the technologies of _aisthēsis_ (the audiovisual or the digital, for example) and, in this way, controlling the conscious and unconscious rhythms of bodies and souls; modulating through the control of flows these rhythms of consciousness and life. … **aesthetic conditioning**, the essential feature of enclosure in these zones, has replaced **aesthetic experience**, making it impossible.”\n\nIn the typical tenor of old guard cultural critics, Stiegler wants to pose this aesthetic disempowerment as total, offering little evidence to argue the point. While a general attitude of aesthetic disempowerment and consumption is certainly present in the West - their most severe forms within the guts of administrative institutions, what David Graeber has called [“dead zones”](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.14318/hau2.2.007) -  it is equally true that there are zones of aesthetic self-determination, willfully defiant against administrative or commercial capture, _fucking_ _everywhere_.\n\nHere at the Open Protocol Research Group, we are most interested in how these zones of defiance, these _undergrounds_, have emergently protocolized, both as a response to legal or extreme cultural prohibition and as a strategy of avoiding institutionalization, with its tendency to dampen or outright restrict the aesthetic autonomy of its participants. When aesthetic practices are outlawed, they respond by protocolizing - one can’t effectively make storefronts or centralized academies for illegal practices. When they protocolize, they become more pluralistic. That pluralism solidifies their resistance or illegibility to institutional capture. [2]\n\nExamples of this **protocol underground** can give us hints as to their plural and creative character. Take for instance, sadomasochism. Originally a diagnostic portmanteau referencing sexual practices from the work of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch and Marquis de Sade, sadism and masochism formalized into an underground scene in the 70’s. [3]  In constant legal flight from sodomy and obscenity laws (due especially to association with the gay community), the scene spread by means of clubs and especially handbooks - notably, Larry Townsend’s [The Leatherman’s Handbook](https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Leatherman_s_Handbook.html?id=Fem3PQAACAAJ) (1972) and later, Jay Wiseman’s [SM 101: A Realistic Introduction](https://books.google.com/books/about/SM_101.html?id=qRCrzBqMSX0C) (1992).\n\nIn these books, one finds a prioritization and careful negotiation of mood or intersubjective atmosphere with rigorous and elaborately defined considerations of consent. Consider Jay Wiseman’s “two squeezes” technique. A proactive measure meant to supplement safe words and provide active and continual consent, the dominant interrupts a session by squeezing the sub’s body twice.\n\n_The two squeezes ask “are you OK?”_\n\n_The submissive replies that they are OK by giving two squeezes in return. The dominant can learn a lot about the submissive’s state by noting how the submissive returns the squeezes. Two quick, brisk squeezes show that the submissive is alert and “in the room with you.” Two long, slow squeezes show that the submissive is OK but “deep under.”_\n\nNo response after a certain time, and the dominant breaks the performance to check in and perhaps end the session. The technique “provides a simple, workable way for both parties to communicate that they are all right without either having to break the mood verbally.”\n\nAnother example of an aesthetic scene that protocolized as it fled culturally prejudice legal action is the UK Free Party Movement. Key dates for this scene: 1990, the passing of the ​​Entertainments (Increased Penalties) Bill, “which raised fines for unlicensed parties from £2,000 to £20,000 with the possibility of six months inside for organisers.” Later that year, the formalization of the sound system collective in North London called Spiral Tribe. May 1992, the biggest illegal rave in UK history in Gloucestershire (infamously known among both Thatcherites and pirate teknivalists as “[Castlemorton](https://djmag.com/features/castlemorton-1992-photographing-illegal-rave-changed-uk-dance-music-forever)”). 1994, the [Criminal Justice and Public Order Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994)  - which “outlawed people gathering listening to music “predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.”\n\n![Members of Spiral Tribe with their infamous sound system.](https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1rHp0f_Wr1Z59ASYxiVbz.webp)\n\nMembers of Spiral Tribe with their infamous sound system.\n\nFree parties dated back to the New Age scene in the eighties (see the 1985 [Battle of the Beanfield](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1doyDQDZtc)) and before, but Spiral Tribe escalated the underground attitude, mainly by insisting that every party they threw fell beyond legal sanction. As member Sebastian Vaughan later wrote,  \"The rave scene seemed to be oscillating towards paid parties and clubs again, and we just said: ‘No way! It’s got to be in a warehouse, it’s got to be dirty, it’s got to be illegal and it’s got to be faceless’.” The ecstasy fueled and elaborately vibed out acid house parties were always free, infected by the attitude of generosity seen in so many aesthetic undergrounds.\n\nMore importantly, they were sometimes extremely hard to find. Listening to Seana Gavin [discuss her time in Spiral Tribe](https://www.ravetothegrave.org/episodes/episode-22-seana-gavin-on-spiral-tribe-and-tekno-adventures), it seems to have been a decade long, transcontinental exercise in getting lost. This was a feature, not a bug. A party, it turns out, takes on a radically different character- an enchantment, even - when everyone present had to go through an ordeal to get there. _12 kms from that pub in poolbrook. Once you make it to Welland, follow the lights_. The obscure and illegal nature of the locations constructed an artifice that repelled complacency and consumption, instead attracting high agency, participation, festive enthusiasm. _If you’ve hit Rye Cross you’ve gone too far._\n\n### Overgrounding\n\nThe underground scenes worthy of investigation are many - consider the libertarian generosity of the price suppression agreed upon by LSD production families in the 70’s, or the manic [protocol creation](https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HONGKONG-EXTRADITIONS-TACTICS/0100B0790FL/index.html) of direct action groups in 2019 Hong Kong or New York as hybrid strategies cross contaminated through continents and different authoritarian atmospheres. Think of the technological détournement in the Bronx that turned drum breaks into a vehicle for a whole [minor poetry](https://books.google.com/books/about/Kafka.html?id=H4XWdN4u4OgC). We intend to do that work. But in these introductory remarks, we can outline a couple key features of the protocol underground, in the hopes that by defining them, we might - in an action as magical as a visionary underground railroad - _**overground**_ them, make of them repeatable and memeable practices, formalized without being standardized.\n\nWhat are the exact qualities that we are attempting to “overground” here?\n\na). Mutual assumption of **high agency**. Undergrounds make play of peril, finding just-sufficient safety in the decentralized ingenuity and practical sense of crowds. The unadministered, it’s been observed, take on a heightened sense of responsibility that paradoxically made pirate events “safe spaces” in multiple senses of the term. (Those who would seek to delegate basic material safety and vigilance to a third party are better off at expensive and highly insured establishments, nested within the promise of lucrative litigation should host guardians misstep.)\n\nb.)  Robust culture of **informed** **consent**. The twentieth century patriarchal establishment was defined by its ambivalence to this term, and it’s a horror-comedy watching institutions try to work through their embedded contradictions to service its supposed cultural vogueness. As an elaboration of the sense of responsibility and presence mentioned above, undergrounds have been avant gardes of mutually affirmed consent.

But this is only sleight of hand, a distortion of the diffuse, field-like character of power and empowerment. Power (politics), in its relationality, is nothing less than this matter of feeling. The philosopher of technology Bernard Stiegler opens his \u003Cem>Symbolic Misery: vol 1 The Hyperindustrial Epoch\u003C/em> (2014) with the following: “The question of politics \u003Cem>is a question of aesthetics\u003C/em>… I use the word aesthetics here in its widest sense, where \u003Cem>aisthēsis\u003C/em> means sensory perception, and where the question of aesthetics is, therefore, that of feeling and sensibility in general.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The object of this piece is the way that aesthetics relate to regimes of structural violence, and the way crypto might fundamentally intervene in and subvert the hegemony of those regimes. In the distributed ledger, we may have the germ of a culture of aesthetic autonomy and free association without limit, coordinating infrastructure unburdened by the pall of coercive relations. Beyond the feeling of administrative bureaucracy, the atmospheric, oh so-subtle implication of violence that permeates the legally sanctioned institutions, we are on the verge of discovering \u003Ca href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2021/03/23/legitimacy.html\">legitimacy\u003C/a> by other means. And when we get to the party, having climbed the plateaus, to reach the plain of an unaccountable and unadministered population, the protocol underground will be there waiting for us.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"undergrounds\">Undergrounds\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>Undergrounds are political. The first use of the term in the sense of “clandestine cultural behaviors” [1] is attached to the American underground railroad, escape routes from the South. The origins of that phrase are disputed: a 1839 newspaper article quoting a young slave who imagined a magical “railroad that goes underground all the way to Boston,” or words elsewhere, around the same time, referencing slave catchers who, having lost the trail, said that “there must be an underground railroad somewhere.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It was first used to refer to subcultures in the early 50’s, fresh off of the memories of the underground media and military campaigns of the French Resistance. At the time, of course, obscenity laws and rigid conformity in the United States meant that alternative aesthetic movements faced repression that rivaled that of Vichy France. If the atmospheres of secret queer gathering places, multi-racial jazz shows and beatnik drug dens didn’t quite have a militant air to them, the codes and protocols established to protect them were as elaborate as those used to evade the Sicherheitsdienst.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>(Riddle: what kind of knowledge is both freely available and deeply secret?)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Undergrounds are political, and politics is a question of aesthetics - sensible communities, intersubjective atmospheres, \u003Cem>vibes\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Stiegler will go on to argue that the dominant “sensible community” of today is “entirely fabricated” by technologies of control: “it has become a matter of controlling the technologies of \u003Cem>aisthēsis\u003C/em> (the audiovisual or the digital, for example) and, in this way, controlling the conscious and unconscious rhythms of bodies and souls; modulating through the control of flows these rhythms of consciousness and life. … \u003Cstrong>aesthetic conditioning\u003C/strong>, the essential feature of enclosure in these zones, has replaced \u003Cstrong>aesthetic experience\u003C/strong>, making it impossible.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the typical tenor of old guard cultural critics, Stiegler wants to pose this aesthetic disempowerment as total, offering little evidence to argue the point. While a general attitude of aesthetic disempowerment and consumption is certainly present in the West - their most severe forms within the guts of administrative institutions, what David Graeber has called \u003Ca href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.14318/hau2.2.007\">“dead zones”\u003C/a> -  it is equally true that there are zones of aesthetic self-determination, willfully defiant against administrative or commercial capture, \u003Cem>fucking\u003C/em> \u003Cem>everywhere\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Here at the Open Protocol Research Group, we are most interested in how these zones of defiance, these \u003Cem>undergrounds\u003C/em>, have emergently protocolized, both as a response to legal or extreme cultural prohibition and as a strategy of avoiding institutionalization, with its tendency to dampen or outright restrict the aesthetic autonomy of its participants. When aesthetic practices are outlawed, they respond by protocolizing - one can’t effectively make storefronts or centralized academies for illegal practices. When they protocolize, they become more pluralistic. That pluralism solidifies their resistance or illegibility to institutional capture. [2]\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Examples of this \u003Cstrong>protocol underground\u003C/strong> can give us hints as to their plural and creative character. Take for instance, sadomasochism. Originally a diagnostic portmanteau referencing sexual practices from the work of Leopold von Sacher-Masoch and Marquis de Sade, sadism and masochism formalized into an underground scene in the 70’s. [3]  In constant legal flight from sodomy and obscenity laws (due especially to association with the gay community), the scene spread by means of clubs and especially handbooks - notably, Larry Townsend’s \u003Ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Leatherman_s_Handbook.html?id=Fem3PQAACAAJ\">The Leatherman’s Handbook\u003C/a> (1972) and later, Jay Wiseman’s \u003Ca href=\"https://books.google.com/books/about/SM_101.html?id=qRCrzBqMSX0C\">SM 101: A Realistic Introduction\u003C/a> (1992).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In these books, one finds a prioritization and careful negotiation of mood or intersubjective atmosphere with rigorous and elaborately defined considerations of consent. Consider Jay Wiseman’s “two squeezes” technique. A proactive measure meant to supplement safe words and provide active and continual consent, the dominant interrupts a session by squeezing the sub’s body twice.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The two squeezes ask “are you OK?”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The submissive replies that they are OK by giving two squeezes in return. The dominant can learn a lot about the submissive’s state by noting how the submissive returns the squeezes. Two quick, brisk squeezes show that the submissive is alert and “in the room with you.” Two long, slow squeezes show that the submissive is OK but “deep under.”\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>No response after a certain time, and the dominant breaks the performance to check in and perhaps end the session. The technique “provides a simple, workable way for both parties to communicate that they are all right without either having to break the mood verbally.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Another example of an aesthetic scene that protocolized as it fled culturally prejudice legal action is the UK Free Party Movement. Key dates for this scene: 1990, the passing of the ​​Entertainments (Increased Penalties) Bill, “which raised fines for unlicensed parties from £2,000 to £20,000 with the possibility of six months inside for organisers.” Later that year, the formalization of the sound system collective in North London called Spiral Tribe. May 1992, the biggest illegal rave in UK history in Gloucestershire (infamously known among both Thatcherites and pirate teknivalists as “\u003Ca href=\"https://djmag.com/features/castlemorton-1992-photographing-illegal-rave-changed-uk-dance-music-forever\">Castlemorton\u003C/a>”). 1994, the \u003Ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Criminal_Justice_and_Public_Order_Act_1994\">Criminal Justice and Public Order Act\u003C/a>  - which “outlawed people gathering listening to music “predominantly characterised by the emission of a succession of repetitive beats.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://images.mirror-media.xyz/publication-images/1rHp0f_Wr1Z59ASYxiVbz.webp\" alt=\"Members of Spiral Tribe with their infamous sound system.\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Members of Spiral Tribe with their infamous sound system.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Free parties dated back to the New Age scene in the eighties (see the 1985 \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1doyDQDZtc\">Battle of the Beanfield\u003C/a>) and before, but Spiral Tribe escalated the underground attitude, mainly by insisting that every party they threw fell beyond legal sanction. As member Sebastian Vaughan later wrote,  “The rave scene seemed to be oscillating towards paid parties and clubs again, and we just said: ‘No way! It’s got to be in a warehouse, it’s got to be dirty, it’s got to be illegal and it’s got to be faceless’.” The ecstasy fueled and elaborately vibed out acid house parties were always free, infected by the attitude of generosity seen in so many aesthetic undergrounds.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>More importantly, they were sometimes extremely hard to find. Listening to Seana Gavin \u003Ca href=\"https://www.ravetothegrave.org/episodes/episode-22-seana-gavin-on-spiral-tribe-and-tekno-adventures\">discuss her time in Spiral Tribe\u003C/a>, it seems to have been a decade long, transcontinental exercise in getting lost. This was a feature, not a bug. A party, it turns out, takes on a radically different character- an enchantment, even - when everyone present had to go through an ordeal to get there. \u003Cem>12 kms from that pub in poolbrook. Once you make it to Welland, follow the lights\u003C/em>. The obscure and illegal nature of the locations constructed an artifice that repelled complacency and consumption, instead attracting high agency, participation, festive enthusiasm. \u003Cem>If you’ve hit Rye Cross you’ve gone too far.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"overgrounding\">Overgrounding\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>The underground scenes worthy of investigation are many - consider the libertarian generosity of the price suppression agreed upon by LSD production families in the 70’s, or the manic \u003Ca href=\"https://www.reuters.com/graphics/HONGKONG-EXTRADITIONS-TACTICS/0100B0790FL/index.html\">protocol creation\u003C/a> of direct action groups in 2019 Hong Kong or New York as hybrid strategies cross contaminated through continents and different authoritarian atmospheres.

We intend to do that work. But in these introductory remarks, we can outline a couple key features of the protocol underground, in the hopes that by defining them, we might - in an action as magical as a visionary underground railroad - \u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>overground\u003C/strong>\u003C/em> them, make of them repeatable and memeable practices, formalized without being standardized.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What are the exact qualities that we are attempting to “overground” here?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>a). Mutual assumption of \u003Cstrong>high agency\u003C/strong>. Undergrounds make play of peril, finding just-sufficient safety in the decentralized ingenuity and practical sense of crowds. The unadministered, it’s been observed, take on a heightened sense of responsibility that paradoxically made pirate events “safe spaces” in multiple senses of the term. (Those who would seek to delegate basic material safety and vigilance to a third party are better off at expensive and highly insured establishments, nested within the promise of lucrative litigation should host guardians misstep.)\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>b.)  Robust culture of \u003Cstrong>informed\u003C/strong> \u003Cstrong>consent\u003C/strong>. The twentieth century patriarchal establishment was defined by its ambivalence to this term, and it’s a horror-comedy watching institutions try to work through their embedded contradictions to service its supposed cultural vogueness. As an elaboration of the sense of responsibility and presence mentioned above, undergrounds have been avant gardes of mutually affirmed consent. Vibes are network forms, and supremacy is a dead ecology.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>c.) \u003Cstrong>Participatory\u003C/strong> and \u003Cstrong>pluralistic\u003C/strong> \u003Cstrong>aesthetic\u003C/strong>.

That research is fundamentally mechanistic: despite its journeying into provocatively illegible corridors [1] - [s&m dungeons, underground free parties, LSD]([[Sketches Toward a Theory of the Protocol Underground]]) - it was never intended to be a mysterian project. On the contrary, just as our friends in web3 have demystified money as a sacred category and brought it down to the plane of technical tweaking and practical revision, the protocol undergrounds are characterized by non-mysterian, empirical engagement with forces that often rule institutions from a hidden seat. \n\nThe variations of [this model](https://grattoncourses.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/structure-sign-and-play-in-the-human-sciences-derrida.pdf) are many. If sex and libidinous power go unspoken in institutional settings, underground critique suggests, it only underwrites the extent to which they often dictate institutional behavior. Schools, offices and prisons pretend a neutral non-aesthetic that barely conceals the [great aesthetic power](https://www.amazon.com/Symbolic-Misery-1-Hyperindustrial-Epoch/dp/0745652654) of those settings. Messy vibes and extitutional forces prevail - all the more readily when their privilege is concealed. The task of the underground, free from the compulsions of institutional life, the positivistic grammars that are so often used to obfuscate a fundamental relationship of control and extraction, is to *materialize* and ***democratize*** these forces. Replacing the anti-empiricism of institutional protocols, the open protocols that animate the undergrounds are *realist*, even and especially if in some conditions that means commerce with dimensions of reality that are, to borrow a phrase, \"real but not actual.\" [2]\n\nThe ***Undercapital*** essay attempted to illustrate how one such force - or maybe a metacategory of many such forces - could be understood as a major feature of economics and governance in extitutional settings: the virtual. As we argued, there are mechanistic social structures in non-institutional life for which a model of the virtual offers unique explanatory power. And yet, if we hope to contribute to the [open protocols]([[Speculative P2P and the Urban Protocol Underground]]) with their assertive memeticism, we have to grapple with the obscurity of that term. \"Virtual\" begs confusion with VR or the colloquial term for the digital realm, while its intended referent is really more of a philosophical dialogue (Deleuze-Bergson-Plato) than a straightforward definition. The term is obscure, but this obscurity is functional.\n\nBrian Massumi, likely the strongest commentator on the virtual since his **Parables of the Virtual** (which weaponized both Deleuze and Bergson's use of the term to wildly exploratory ends), writes here of the inherent difficulty of the term: \n\n>    The virtual is a slippery concept. It is by nature elusive. I call it \"recessive.\" It does not expend itself in its effect. It withdraws back into itself, constituting in the same stroke the just-past of that effect, and the to-come of the next. It is always in the gaps between chronological moments, in a nonlinear, recursive time of its own: just past-yet to come; future-past. When the virtual withdraws back into itself in the gaps in the actual, it has no \"place\" to go. It goes only in its own return. [3]\n\nIn the spirit of demystification and practical efficacy, we will avoid this slippery game for now and describe an encounter with the virtual as \"a generative experience of nondual potentiality.\" Why these descriptors? First, it involves a breakdown of subject-object boundaries - it is, to use Massumi's language, \"intensive\" rather than extensive or extrinsic, meaning it deals in qualitative, affective, processual, pre-representational, raw experience. This nondual character of the virtual, to distinguish from certain religious experiences, is not quietist: it invites into action, disjoints the time and the categorical rule, and gives permission to ways of inhabiting the world unthinkable to a given representational regime. As noted in the original **Undercapital** essay, the common report from certain events and parties, or sometimes radical moments of romantic/sexual intimacy, \"that night it felt like anything was possible\" is a perfect encapsulation of the generativity and potentiality of the virtual. \n\nTo survey the protocol underground is to survey an expanse of economic and organizational artifices developed around this experience of nondual possibility as a *practical asset*. It is recessive, yes - those nights of possibility are scarce and fragile - but the practicalism of the underground asserts this nondual experience is **not supernatural**, not something to be quarantined into place where it can be a site of collusion, a source of arbitrary authority. Instead, it should be encountered, poked, engaged - directly. It is (as we are) *material*: despite its reclusiveness or agential capacity [4] to withdrawal at will, it is available to us.\n\n---\n## Does the Virtual Animate Landua's Eight Forms of Capital?\n\nUndercapital was [originally posed](https://www.extitutional.space/Articles/Undercapital) as an expanse of economic activity made legible once we include virtual capital as a ninth term in Gregory Landua's seminal Eight Forms of Capital.[5] This includes not only the opportunity for the multiple forms of money (unit of account, means of exchange, store of value) to be applied to the diverse interests of the eight forms, but also the tendency of the forms to ***recede into themselves*** in corridors of value which express their virtual life. Even financial capital has a perverse ecstasy of arbitrary quantification which leads to a generative vision of the nondual, [6] but one can picture the spectrum: cultural capital felt in its pure network value, beholden to nothing else; psilocybin or other mindful retreats of the nondual as corridors into living capital as an end in itself. Who among us hasn't felt the lazy-stoned-day comfort of immersion into what those on the extensive plane would call social capital (i.e., friendship)? How many industrial traffickers of quartz or bauxite have been touched by the profound in-itselfness of material capital? No mere means, but an end.[7]\n\n![diagram](https://github.com/Clinamenic/Open-Mutualism-Guild/blob/v4/Screenshot%202025-03-28%20at%209.03.04%E2%80%AFPM.png?raw=true)\n\nThe virtual can be thought of as the *silent partner* of capital itself - that oft-obfuscated presence that permits and sustains the normal workings of capital in its quantification and valuation. Undercapital is what happens when this silent partner is acknowledged, freely socialized, invited in the room to have a seat, have a say in the matter. Where capital thought it convenient to make of the virtual either an unattainable end (to be desired) or a qualitative Other (to be feared), undercapital sees something that is immediately available for the minor but compounding transfigurations of a creative and open life. \n\nIn magical or religious literature, in military hymns or national anthems, even corporate mythology, this intersubjective becoming is posed as a cartoon of absolute solemnity, unreachably profound or sentimental and more often than not conflated with death. If its power, its ability to inject substance and momentum into a system cannot be ignored or filtered out, it can at least be made distant and untouchable by the pseudoreligious (or sometimes religious) systems of institutional propaganda. In the underground, on the contrary, the direct encounter with it is an every day activity. It is not anything ultimate: it does not give anyone powers of omnipotence, it does not defeat the day to day fluctuations of awkwardness and belonging, discontent and relative happiness. The term is not abstract, it just refers to another regime of material experience. \n\nAnd this demystification as well calls for prying out the socialized virtual from the exceptional and often youth or class-contingent experiences where we are most familiar with it. Undercapital says: **There is a viable engineering space of processual, nondualist design that undergrounds are only a hints of.** We see them circulating protocols, constructing how-to guides, develop best practices not for the end of accumulation, not for remote ends at all, but to locate an in itselfness felt in its direct, unmediated presence. The ethos thrives in the world of art and dance. It can thrive too in the world of food production, medicine, economics, co-living. The challenge of the underground and of undercapital says: We have to start thinking of social organization in terms of public management and private obfuscation of wells of nondual experience.\n\n---\n### We have to start thinking of social organization in terms of community management and private obfuscation of wells of nondual experience.\n\n---\n\nThe virtual, then, is a bridge to another regime of experience, one which has immense creative power subjectively, and a core structural or logistical power inasmuch as it is able to *move bodies*. The legibility and democratization of these nondual states is an immensely consequential problem inasmuch as *concealment and capture of virtual energies is a vector of control*, just as mutual knowledge and horizontal social engagement with the virtual is a passage of collective liberation. Demystification and personalization of this experiential realm which is known to moves masses is a pressing issue of our time, all the more so for its invisibility to well-meaning rationalists, scientific positivists, and all those who either deny or place in divine exile the plain presence of the nondual as an aspect of the material world. \n\nBut nondual experience is not deterministic, and visitation to the realm of undercapital is not terminal. Beyond demystification and socialization, there is a pathway of reciprocity and exchange between the structural and the processual, inasmuch as nondual engagements with material singularities are also sites of **neuroplasticity** capable of deprogramming destructive or zombie dependency on regimes of knowledge which have ceased to serve their purpose. Through immersion in this process space - once called \"the Mauve Zone\" by a certain occult practitioner - one finds potential for ontological regimes that are tolerant of different kinds of agencies, be they distributed cognitions, ecological agents, animals, plants, mycelia, protozoa, even living concepts and \"colors out of space.\" \n\n---\n## 'Undualing': Nature as Parallax\n\n[The array of potential minds](https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-intelligence/) is vast, their presence potential ubiquitous. Our mobility between structural hierarchies of agency - regimes that might afford, in their multiplicity, the full spectrum of what lives and thinks - depends on our access to mauve zones of plasticity that allow for travel between them. The virtual should not be instrumentalized to an external end, but it does constitute a resource beyond its immanent experience inasmuch as recognition of the broader fields of reality is key to our survival.\n\nThe intended end of this essay was the work of Austin Wade Smith, whose \"Undualing\" unlocked for me a more legible approach to the Undercapital question (with its semantically slippery \"virtual\" core). If these wells of nondual experience have ethical consequence in their functionality - the temptation of elites and central bodies to capture, conceal and manhandle processual experience to the ends of population control - they might have greater consequence in their role as tunnels or wormholes to *alternative regimes of* *reciprocity*:  \"Rather than a world co-created by a multitude of players, locations, and timelines,\" AWS writes, \"the dualism at the heart of modernity is a retreat from a diverse set of “worlding” practices to one universal world, centralized across time and space... Undualing is the invitation to thicken the cast of characters which create value and sustain planetary livelihood. It is the practice of reanimating lifeworlds against forces of singularization. It resists the collapsing of many to the few.\" \n\nWithin the undual multitude, we find a whole panorama of regimes of experience, all negotiating the structural and the processual. Moreover, each of these regimes is calibrated to recognize and to elaborate upon different orders of entities. It would be an insult to call this panoramic entanglement and multiscale intelligence of the plane of nature \"extitutional\" - rather we should say that institutional life is defined by stubborn and crystallized modes woefully bereft of the plasticity and fluency needed to encounter natural intelligences (including ourselves) in their inherent multiplicity. \n\nThe virtual, with its vision of parallax or superposed potency, is the very vehicle for traversing between these lenses - as well as the tether that holds them in enough mutual coherence to remain grounded and socially coherent. If the fate of undercapital is to leave the special autonomous zones of the underground and weave this potent force of undualing into the procedural realms of economic organization, governance, and social production, it will need wild technical frameworks.\n\n## Conclusion: Toward Vagabond Technologies\n\nIn *A Thousand Plateaus*, Deleuze and Guattari invoke a \"protogeometry that addresses vague, in other words, vagabond or nomadic, morphological essences.\" These are different than the structural and enclosed categories of institutions life; they are \"distinct from sensible things, as well as from ideal, royal, or imperial essences. Protogeometry, the science dealing with them, is itself vague, in the etymo- logical sense of \"vagabond\": it is neither inexact like sensible things nor exact like ideal essences, but *anexact yet rigorous* (essentially and not accidentally inexact)... It could be said that vague essences extract from things a determination that is more than *thinghood* (choseite), which is that of *corporeality* (corporeite), and which perhaps even implies an *esprit de corps.*\" [8]\n\nThe text is discussing the same question of subjugating, concealing or foregrounding the virtual that is the subject of this piece, and proposes the internal coherence of a nomad science of \"vague essences\", of potent corporeality beyond thinghood. Given the context of open web protocolization and technologically aided experimental governance, the grabbing back of categories of money and legitimate statefulness into the realm of practical experimentation from which the undercapital thesis emerged, the way forward must assert a technological optimism that is also nomad, a vagabond technology, adequate to the blurry in-betweens of the many regimes of things. \n\nThis project will continue with three candidates for vagabond technologies that offer paths forward for undercapital design: \n\n- Intent centric web3 applications (of the kind explored by [Anoma](https://anoma.net))\n- [Feral Computing](https://mirror.xyz/austinwadesmith.eth/wrBCeIWNsXbseQiLBj5jR_bkMFZ03nNYs4rg0lU8X2s) a (a kind of practice of applied technological undualing being developed by Austin Wade Smith - further entries in this project will explore feral computing in greater detail)\n- Field Ontology Method (a personal prototype for instrument-based encounters with nonhuman ecologies under pluralistic knowledge regimes).\n\nUndercapital's technological optimism is one of ethical creativity, but it's equally about the subversive power gained when social bodies assert the naturalistic immediacy of liminal and nondual states - not as sacred or remote, but as an inherent feature of the dynamism of the plane of nature. \n\nStay tuned.\n\n\n## Notes\n\n[1] By illegible here we mean in the James S Scott sense of legibility before administrative bodies, the eyes of the State. \n\n[2] “But let a noise or a scent, once heard or once smelt, be heard or smelt again in the present and at the same time in the past, real without being actual, ideal without being abstract, and immediately the permanent and habitually concealed essence of things is liberated and our true self, which seemed — had perhaps for long years seemed — to be dead but was not altogether dead, is awakened and reanimated as it receives the celestial nourishment that is brought to it.  A minute freed from the order of time has been re-created in us, to feel it, the man freed from the order of time. And one can understand that this man should have confidence in his joy, even if the simple taste of a madeleine does not seem logically to contain within it the reasons for this joy, one can understand that the word “death” should have no meaning for him; situated outside time, why should he fear the future?\" Marcel Proust, *In Search of Lost Time VI, Time Regained*, 265.\n\n[3] Brian Massumi, [*Couplets*](https://www.dukeupress.edu/couplets).\n\n[4] The virtual has a non-determistic, temperamental quality that makes for a kind of proto-animism common in protocol undergrounds: everywhere one finds lore about the vibe and its tendency to come and go at will.\n\n[5] The yield from the insight of the eight forms is uncountable. Support intellectual capital - [buy this book](https://www.amazon.com/Regenerative-Enterprise-Optimizing-Multi-capital-Abundance-ebook/dp/B093ZVLBXH)!.\n\n[6] The perversity was never the ecstasy itself, but its concentration in the halls of coercive power: one could imagine festivals of quantification that celebrate the uncanny infinities of the analogue in relation to social digitization.\n\n[7] Industry experts in whatever form of capital is most valuable to a given channel of institutional extraction must always hazard *undercapital*: rogue agents that ride too deep into the expanse of whatever territory you are grabbing and discover a nondual state. Commodity becomes in-itselfness, and commerce becomes secondary to the pure creative act, the flowering and peristent expression of that nondual multiplicity; see [*Phantom Thread*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNsiQMeSvMk).\n\n[8] Deleuze and Guattari, [A Thousand Plateaus](https://files.libcom.org/files/A%20Thousand%20Plateaus.pdf), 367.","src/content/essays/Undercapital Redux.md","7eb295c49d40536c",{"html":272,"metadata":273},"\u003Ch1 id=\"undercapital-redux-economic-design-underneath-the-world\">Undercapital \u003Cem>Redux\u003C/em>: Economic Design ‘Underneath the World’\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Sous le monde réel, il existe un monde idéal, qui se montre resplendissant à l’œil de ceux que des méditations graves ont accoutumés à voir dans les choses plus que les choses.\u003C/em>\n-\u003Cstrong>Victor Hugo\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>Undualing\u003C/strong> is a means of preparing ground.\u003C/em>\n-\u003Cstrong>Austin Wade Smith\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"protocol-undergrounds-and-the-force-of-the-virtual\">Protocol Undergrounds and the Force of the Virtual\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Our project at OPRG began (and remains) an investigation into a structural analogy between open protocols of the web and the open cultural and technical protocols that drive and sustain underground cultures.

Through immersion in this process space - once called “the Mauve Zone” by a certain occult practitioner - one finds potential for ontological regimes that are tolerant of different kinds of agencies, be they distributed cognitions, ecological agents, animals, plants, mycelia, protozoa, even living concepts and “colors out of space.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"undualing-nature-as-parallax\">’Undualing’: Nature as Parallax\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://www.noemamag.com/ai-could-be-a-bridge-toward-diverse-intelligence/\">The array of potential minds\u003C/a> is vast, their presence potential ubiquitous.

It is the practice of reanimating lifeworlds against forces of singularization. It resists the collapsing of many to the few.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Within the undual multitude, we find a whole panorama of regimes of experience, all negotiating the structural and the processual. Moreover, each of these regimes is calibrated to recognize and to elaborate upon different orders of entities. It would be an insult to call this panoramic entanglement and multiscale intelligence of the plane of nature “extitutional” - rather we should say that institutional life is defined by stubborn and crystallized modes woefully bereft of the plasticity and fluency needed to encounter natural intelligences (including ourselves) in their inherent multiplicity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The virtual, with its vision of parallax or superposed potency, is the very vehicle for traversing between these lenses - as well as the tether that holds them in enough mutual coherence to remain grounded and socially coherent.

It’s a locked event of sustained difference, and any attempt to assert control finds a dissident underground sprouting like daffodils. To paraphrase a certain anarchist Russian poet, “The city is not equal to itself - it stirs and vulcanates.” [1]\n\nCan the same be categorically said of Ethereum? Can we will that? To Ethereum’s novice, the city is a master. But this can’t be a simple matter of learning a prescribed tradition, given that the tradition under discussion is self-overcoming. No, in the inverted logic of the urban local, with its understories and subterranean engines, the master and the student collapse into the substrate plane of *practical potential*. A possibility space opens up: what can an ethereal body do? How can an alliance between two nodes of anticapture become more monstrous, more open, more self-overcoming?\n\n-----\n\nOur investigations into the urban space began with an initial claim: distinct kinds of open source social protocols found in cities - and particularly in cultural undergrounds - are robustly isomorphic with those of the web3 space, and represent an opportunity for intervention and alliance. That research quickly took us to further reaches, extitutions, protocol undergrounds and the speculative realism they harbor. The Undercapital thesis is what resulted, designating multicapital economic strategies brought to bear to forms of relation illegible to states and institutions but which Ethereum, with its open ontology, could service without flinching.\n\nWhile these conceptual flights had us at times moving further than our empirical and ethnographic resources could justify - making them provisional frames rather than analytic conclusions - it's our hope that readers find in this overview a skeleton for their own investigation into the urban cultural possibilities of Ethereum localism.\n\n\n### Open Protocols\n\nFrom early on in the research vector, we understood that the open protocols of the cultural field had a primary difference from those within a virtual network: while open web protocols depend on a shared computational substrate - a standard - open protocols of the urban field have only practical adequacy, the hardness of certain material conditions and the shifting features of the socio-cognitive fabric of the city as their shared substrate. \n\nDespite this fact, the propagation of these urban protocols formally mirrors what we see in the Ethereum ecosystem in distinct ways. (Informally) codified knowledge sets for urban gardening, for community organizing or throwing a party in an unregulated setting, for squatting a warehouse or wheatpasting a message or getting a zine out, spread in a free and coherent manner ambivalent to traditional institutional infrastructure. They fork and merge to meet different landscapes of implementation. Teams of developers find temporary cultural cache and then dissolve into the milieu, while their creations persist and change. Most importantly, all of this social and intellectual reproduction happens outside of the channels of institutional control and coercion. Open protocolization, it became clear, was the fate of knowledge outside of the walls of institutional sanction. \n\nUnsheltered from these boundaries, with their organizational propaganda, bureaucratic compulsions and procedural ossification, open protocols face the hard realities and pressures of the outside - institutional coherence is instead replaced by productive fracture, and impractical strategies are naturally selected out by the experience of free agents. [2] This was expressed in what we called \"a twin commitment to divergent exploration and material grounding,\" that is, characteristic features of memeticism and empiricism that seem unavoidable for protocols in extitutional settings. [3] In retrospect we might say that open protocols are about hacking the material world to find wells of possibility space: the twin question is always, *does it work* (performative or impractical gestures don't survive) and *does it allow me to improvise, generate novelty, be creative?* (If a protocolist was interested in following orders, they'd join an institution.)\n\nThis broad grammar for seeing the city, as it were, inverted, led to several insights. We'll give them an overview, then return to what the open protocol framework might imply for local interventions by Ethereum and how it might even help us better understand Ethereum itself, what it is and where it’s going as it likewise searches the economic and computational ruliad for its own possibility wells. \n\n### Extitutions\n\nAs the Ethereum ecosystem itself has found, because of the heavy grasp that legacy infrastructure has on the flows of economic and intellectual reproduction, an institutional \"front\" is sometimes needed to maintain protocols in their open and free form, taking the place of interlocutor with legacy forces while they construct autonomous zones which will inevitably intentionally obsolete them. What exactly this looks like in the Ethereum space is a complicated question - you can use your imagination - but in the urban sphere, they operate with a distinct purity and levity that makes them easy to identify. \n\nThe archetype of the extitution - for us, deployed as a slight alteration of Jessie Kate Schingler and Primavera de Filippi’s extitutional theory [4] to mean distinct entities rather than informal undersides of institutions themselves - was a Portland friend's description of the late 90's/early 2000's indie scene. To paraphrase: *We were starting record labels like it was nothing, running them into the ground and starting over. Call it a way of protecting ourselves from success.* \"Extitutions,\" we wrote in our first document, \"wear institutional masks\" - they're formal status tells one story, but any organizational planner or MBA would be stunned at the irresponsibility, or incoherence, with which they wield this entity.\n\nIf this is the case, it is because their \"legibility\" is a farce, their coherence accountable to an utterly different calculus: the free propagation of the protocol. \n\n### Protocol Undergrounds\n\nThis touches on a key dimension of open protocols, mainly that they are inextricably linked to cultural undergrounds. In a fruitful foray into a more archival approach to the protocol underground question, we looked at four historical cases: the California LSD scene of the 70s and 80s, the UK Free Party Movement, the West Coast Appropriate Technology Movement of the 70's and the Bay Area S&M scene of the same time. For each of these scenes, we identified an extitution (the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, Spiral Tribe, RAIN and the Society of Janus, respectively) and a value it distinctly embodied/ helped export to the cultural field.\n\n\n|                        |                             |                     |\n| ---------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------- |\n| **Open Protocol**      | **Extitution**              | **Value**           |\n| LSD                    | Brotherhood of Eternal Love | cognitive pluralism |\n| Free Party             | Spiral Tribe                | high agency         |\n| Appropriate Technology | RAIN                        | autonomy            |\n| S/M                    | Society of Janus            | consent             |\n\n\nNotably, all of the above protocols were culturally marginalized and, at one point or another, very illegal - this seems to have been a historical prerequisite for the development of autonomous values. For more on these particular scenes, you can check out my Local DAO Summer talk [5] and our second essay, \"Sketches Toward a Theory of the Protocol Underground\" [6], but the crucial point is how they helped us construct a set of characteristics to not just explain the protocol underground, but the nature of the alternative values that keep its inhabitants avoiding institutional scaling at all costs. \n\nLater, in \"Undercapital,\" [7] we identified three hazards of scaling that inform the intentionality of the underground:  1) Institutional-behavioral bias, a set of regulatory and cultural \"multipolar traps\" that lead to reflexively policed passive consumption (elsewhere known as the problem of spectacle) 2) Limits to circulation of scene protocols, wherein mutual expectations of high agency and consent are logistically difficult to scale vertically, 3) Cults of personality, for obvious reasons including internal capture, the degrading presence of a figurehead to withdraw agency to, and a target for external capture.\n\nTo quote from “Sketches”: \"there is no objective vibe, there is no monopoly of the real. Feeling, sense, atmosphere are relational, and without institutions to impose a mystified neutrality - the oppressive, monoculture din of a Walgreens, bank, or a hospital - we are challenged with the responsibility and freedom to constitute for ourselves what the sense of things are, and in so doing, redefine what possibilities exist in them.\" Of course members of the underground depart, conform, become institutional subjects through and through, but the underground persists because its forms are innately decentralized, capture resistant, modular, free and open.\n\n\n### Speculative Realism & Undercapital\n\nIn the farthest reaches of our thinking this year, we realized the ontological significance of the alternative and aggressively pluralistic tactics of the open protocol form, one that points to a much needed cultural orientation for the Ethereum ecosystem itself. \n\nBy ontology, we mean, of course, what is real - namely, what entities enjoy legibility in a system when you're drawing one up. If cultural undergrounds are ontologically creative (in part because of their deployment of a maximally permissive knowledge reproduction strategy), it is because their acute sense of aesthetic self-determination - against all passivity and spectacle - ceases to be disciplined into a category of art and infects all manner of organizational logistics, governance and economics. In cultural undergrounds, the pluralistic forking of open protocols locates itself at the speculative edge of the real, and its empirical imagination actively builds around exotic entities: scene egregores, crowd consciousnesses, agential vibes and colors out of space.   \n\nTo speak of these entities in institutional time is to be subject to ridicule, but immersion into the protocol underground is an empirical ordeal that alters your tolerance quotient of what is real by showing you, through inputs and outputs, what works. The economic space of undercapital is rich with empirically realized, underinstitutional inputs and outputs that point the way toward a pragmatic, formalized, interoperable action space under a condition of social creativity and imagination. \n\n\n### Ethereum as a tool for Prefigurative Infrastructure\n\nIf there is a meaningful consistency between the extitutional strategy of open protocolization and the proliferation of open web protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem, the question becomes, where has one succeeded where the other has failed?  \n\nFor the undergrounds, it’s on the level of cultural imagination, for they have elevated the death of institutional values to an ontological status and discovered new seats of agency that point to new ways of living in the world. In flights of microeconomic planning and ad hoc governance, they have developed atmospheres and corridors of social life that are peopled with far weirder creatures than any institutionally sanctioned humanism could contain. \n\nOn the other hand, these experiments in many-worlding remain scarce, offering little threat of competition to the dominant systems that enjoy robust channels of expansion and reproduction. Reproducing without the above mentioned “hazards of scaling” has remained a taboo for these undergrounds, while for the Ethereum community, the nurturing and resourcing of free protocols is a technical problem with dozens of engineered solutions, from DAOs to self curated registries to token engineering and exotic participatory funding strategies to the many hybrids between them. \n\nCities represent an ancient and creative locus for the capture and censorship resistance Ethereum aspires to. If their cultural undergrounds have long since discovered open protocolization as a natural defense against an (often legally enforced) institutional hegemony, along with scenes and extitutional storefronts to expand those protocols, their sole limitation is the one of scaling. To our eye, many scene veterans are morbidly content with the fatalism of this project: to scale is to die (a sensible impulse, given the barriers mentioned above). Against this self-reinforcing impasse, Ethereum’s pragmatic sensibility offers an exit: in a machinic, thermodynamically grounded *formalization without institutions*, the social tendency to pluralism and empathic imagination could be unleashed.\n\n  \n**The Open Protocol Research Group is Ven Gist, MacksWolf and Exeunt.

What exactly this looks like in the Ethereum space is a complicated question - you can use your imagination - but in the urban sphere, they operate with a distinct purity and levity that makes them easy to identify. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The archetype of the extitution - for us, deployed as a slight alteration of Jessie Kate Schingler and Primavera de Filippi’s extitutional theory [4] to mean distinct entities rather than informal undersides of institutions themselves - was a Portland friend’s description of the late 90’s/early 2000’s indie scene. To paraphrase: \u003Cem>We were starting record labels like it was nothing, running them into the ground and starting over. Call it a way of protecting ourselves from success.\u003C/em> “Extitutions,” we wrote in our first document, “wear institutional masks” - they’re formal status tells one story, but any organizational planner or MBA would be stunned at the irresponsibility, or incoherence, with which they wield this entity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If this is the case, it is because their “legibility” is a farce, their coherence accountable to an utterly different calculus: the free propagation of the protocol. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"protocol-undergrounds\">Protocol Undergrounds\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>This touches on a key dimension of open protocols, mainly that they are inextricably linked to cultural undergrounds. In a fruitful foray into a more archival approach to the protocol underground question, we looked at four historical cases: the California LSD scene of the 70s and 80s, the UK Free Party Movement, the West Coast Appropriate Technology Movement of the 70’s and the Bay Area S&#x26;M scene of the same time. For each of these scenes, we identified an extitution (the Brotherhood of Eternal Love, Spiral Tribe, RAIN and the Society of Janus, respectively) and a value it distinctly embodied/ helped export to the cultural field.\u003C/p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u003Ctable>\u003Cthead>\u003Ctr>\u003Cth>\u003C/th>\u003Cth>\u003C/th>\u003Cth>\u003C/th>\u003C/tr>\u003C/thead>\u003Ctbody>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Open Protocol\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Extitution\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>\u003Cstrong>Value\u003C/strong>\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>LSD\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Brotherhood of Eternal Love\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>cognitive pluralism\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Free Party\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Spiral Tribe\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>high agency\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>Appropriate Technology\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>RAIN\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>autonomy\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003Ctr>\u003Ctd>S/M\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>Society of Janus\u003C/td>\u003Ctd>consent\u003C/td>\u003C/tr>\u003C/tbody>\u003C/table>\n\u003Cp>Notably, all of the above protocols were culturally marginalized and, at one point or another, very illegal - this seems to have been a historical prerequisite for the development of autonomous values. For more on these particular scenes, you can check out my Local DAO Summer talk [5] and our second essay, “Sketches Toward a Theory of the Protocol Underground” [6], but the crucial point is how they helped us construct a set of characteristics to not just explain the protocol underground, but the nature of the alternative values that keep its inhabitants avoiding institutional scaling at all costs. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Later, in “Undercapital,” [7] we identified three hazards of scaling that inform the intentionality of the underground:  1) Institutional-behavioral bias, a set of regulatory and cultural “multipolar traps” that lead to reflexively policed passive consumption (elsewhere known as the problem of spectacle) 2) Limits to circulation of scene protocols, wherein mutual expectations of high agency and consent are logistically difficult to scale vertically, 3) Cults of personality, for obvious reasons including internal capture, the degrading presence of a figurehead to withdraw agency to, and a target for external capture.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To quote from “Sketches”: “there is no objective vibe, there is no monopoly of the real. Feeling, sense, atmosphere are relational, and without institutions to impose a mystified neutrality - the oppressive, monoculture din of a Walgreens, bank, or a hospital - we are challenged with the responsibility and freedom to constitute for ourselves what the sense of things are, and in so doing, redefine what possibilities exist in them.” Of course members of the underground depart, conform, become institutional subjects through and through, but the underground persists because its forms are innately decentralized, capture resistant, modular, free and open.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"speculative-realism--undercapital\">Speculative Realism &#x26; Undercapital\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>In the farthest reaches of our thinking this year, we realized the ontological significance of the alternative and aggressively pluralistic tactics of the open protocol form, one that points to a much needed cultural orientation for the Ethereum ecosystem itself. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>By ontology, we mean, of course, what is real - namely, what entities enjoy legibility in a system when you’re drawing one up. If cultural undergrounds are ontologically creative (in part because of their deployment of a maximally permissive knowledge reproduction strategy), it is because their acute sense of aesthetic self-determination - against all passivity and spectacle - ceases to be disciplined into a category of art and infects all manner of organizational logistics, governance and economics. In cultural undergrounds, the pluralistic forking of open protocols locates itself at the speculative edge of the real, and its empirical imagination actively builds around exotic entities: scene egregores, crowd consciousnesses, agential vibes and colors out of space. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To speak of these entities in institutional time is to be subject to ridicule, but immersion into the protocol underground is an empirical ordeal that alters your tolerance quotient of what is real by showing you, through inputs and outputs, what works. The economic space of undercapital is rich with empirically realized, underinstitutional inputs and outputs that point the way toward a pragmatic, formalized, interoperable action space under a condition of social creativity and imagination. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch3 id=\"ethereum-as-a-tool-for-prefigurative-infrastructure\">Ethereum as a tool for Prefigurative Infrastructure\u003C/h3>\n\u003Cp>If there is a meaningful consistency between the extitutional strategy of open protocolization and the proliferation of open web protocols in the Ethereum ecosystem, the question becomes, where has one succeeded where the other has failed?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For the undergrounds, it’s on the level of cultural imagination, for they have elevated the death of institutional values to an ontological status and discovered new seats of agency that point to new ways of living in the world. In flights of microeconomic planning and ad hoc governance, they have developed atmospheres and corridors of social life that are peopled with far weirder creatures than any institutionally sanctioned humanism could contain. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the other hand, these experiments in many-worlding remain scarce, offering little threat of competition to the dominant systems that enjoy robust channels of expansion and reproduction. Reproducing without the above mentioned “hazards of scaling” has remained a taboo for these undergrounds, while for the Ethereum community, the nurturing and resourcing of free protocols is a technical problem with dozens of engineered solutions, from DAOs to self curated registries to token engineering and exotic participatory funding strategies to the many hybrids between them. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Cities represent an ancient and creative locus for the capture and censorship resistance Ethereum aspires to. If their cultural undergrounds have long since discovered open protocolization as a natural defense against an (often legally enforced) institutional hegemony, along with scenes and extitutional storefronts to expand those protocols, their sole limitation is the one of scaling. To our eye, many scene veterans are morbidly content with the fatalism of this project: to scale is to die (a sensible impulse, given the barriers mentioned above). Against this self-reinforcing impasse, Ethereum’s pragmatic sensibility offers an exit: in a machinic, thermodynamically grounded \u003Cem>formalization without institutions\u003C/em>, the social tendency to pluralism and empathic imagination could be unleashed.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>The Open Protocol Research Group is Ven Gist, MacksWolf and Exeunt.

That is, the pre-WWII historian and literary critic Lewis Mumford’s technological theory of history, given in his book [Technics and Civilization](https://monoskop.org/images/f/fa/Mumford_Lewis_Technics_and_Civilization.pdf). … Don’t worry, we didn’t actually read this 1934 tome (or not all of it) - only stumbled upon it by way of the much more fun and straightforward work of C4SS’s Kevin A. Carson. Carson, who happens to be a [huge scifi nerd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYEbjgpbr0&t=283s), has many books worth checking out, but the one we keep returning to (and that contains Mumford’s frame) is [The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low Overhead Manifesto](https://kevinacarson.org/pdf/hir.pdf).\n\nIn the preface, Carson narrates Mumford’s three epochs of technological revolution since the middle age. The first, called “eotechnic”, refers to the period between the fifteenth and the eighteenth century, characterized by mechanistic results of the early scientific imagination, clockwork machinery, advanced agriculture and horticulture methods, and most importantly for Mumford’s argument, water and wind power. Because of the naturally distributed nature of this energy source, innovation took on a deeply heterogeneous character: you might find three radically different windmill or watermill prototypes just miles away along the Rhine. The political economy of this time in Europe is a complex issue, but one might notice that this period corresponds to the last stand of the landed peasantry and the existence of the commons before the Enclosure movements of the late 17th and 18th century.\n\nThe next period, called “paleotechnic,” is one of centralization and reinvigorated state power, again determined by a dominant energy source and its effect on production:\n\n> The so‐called “Industrial Revolution,” in conventional parlance, conflates two distinct phenomena: the development of mechanized processes for specific kinds of production (spinning and weaving, in particular), and the harnessing of the steam engine as a prime mover. The former was a direct outgrowth of the mechanical science of the eotechnic phase, and would have been fully compatible with production in the small shop if not for the practical issues raised by steam power. The imperative to concentrate machine production in large factories resulted, not from the requirements of machine production as such, but from the need to economize on steam power.\n\nYou can see where this is going: the concentration of productive capacities, the emphasis on extractivism and mercantilism, the East India Trading Company, the pollution and cutthroat capitalism of 19th century Western Europe are all sprouted from this initial mobilization around an expensive and concentrated energy capacity.\n\nMumford’s third stage dates to the late nineteenth century, the **neotechnic**, an “electricity and alloy complex” to replace the rule of coal and iron. And with it, the potential for **a restoration of autonomy and decentralized production**, the dampening of state power. Carson notes that this period roughly corresponds to the writing of the utopian mutualist anarchist Peter Kropotkin. The neotechnic phase was a continuation of the heterogeneity and distributed innovation of the eotechnic period, even implying a “marriage of town and country, of industry and agriculture” (Mumford) as horticultural innovation could flourish on the same level as technologically emboldened workshop and village innovation. Refined tools for the circulation of information could mean diverse branches of innovation aiding and multiplying each other.\n\nAs Carson notes, much in line with Michel Bauwens' work on [peer production](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Sources_of_P2P_Theory), these utopian tools of decentralized technological power are now well developed. And yet, from the perspective of Technics and History, we still live in the long eighteenth century - the neotechnic toolkit remains underutilized (except by urban and rural pioneers of autonomy of the type cities like Portland and Berlin know well). More importantly, the political exit from extractivist and centralized regimes has not caught up with the liberatory capacities of the neotechnic energy paradigm.\n\nUnder the executive sovereignty of an 81 year old president, we seem to live in the dead shell of an obsolete power system. But, as all technological optimists know, regimes of production and coordination have the power to leave behind unjust and insufficient political structures. Whither Target, down with the banks. **We are the neotechnics, and we will decentralize across scales!**\n\n—\n\n**“WE ARE THE NEOTECHNICS!”**\n\n—\n\nPortland is home to a robust underground infrastructure of local-scale production capacities. We say underground because you can walk right by these warehouses and minor complexes, full of hardware hackers and woodshops, CNC machines and welding stations without noticing. To illustrate, here is a rough map, stripped of names, of spaces we are aware of with some or all of these capacities, offered cheap or freely and run at a community level:\n\n![pdxdmakermap2](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SystE8q26.jpg)\n\nOne thing we notice hanging out in these spaces is how familiar to the web3 spirit their members are. These renegade technologists tend to value horizontal organizing and the intergroup discipline of well-maintained commons, mixed with an unapologetic sense of individualism and non-negotiable autonomy. **They are neotechnics like us.** And yet, even though they are so close, many of these shops remain insulated from each other, surprisingly unaware of the other workshops around. (As one welder told us while building a cargo bike, 'when I have my head in a project, I'm not thinking about other people's shit.') They haven't bridged the gap from personal economy to political economy because they haven’t discovered the coordination infrastructure to scale. **Maybe that’s where web3 comes in.**","src/content/essays/We Are the Neotechnics.md","d5284afa58c6a8b4",{"html":357,"metadata":358},"\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Tl;dr\u003C/em> \u003Cem>As a corollary and expansion to Vitalik Buterin’s philosophy of technological optimism (d/acc), we invoke Lewis Mumford’s \u003Cstrong>neotechnic revolution\u003C/strong>, a transition to decentralized power structures catalyzed by alternatives to fossil fuels.

Carson, who happens to be a \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OgYEbjgpbr0&#x26;t=283s\">huge scifi nerd\u003C/a>, has many books worth checking out, but the one we keep returning to (and that contains Mumford’s frame) is \u003Ca href=\"https://kevinacarson.org/pdf/hir.pdf\">The Homebrew Industrial Revolution: A Low Overhead Manifesto\u003C/a>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In the preface, Carson narrates Mumford’s three epochs of technological revolution since the middle age. The first, called “eotechnic”, refers to the period between the fifteenth and the eighteenth century, characterized by mechanistic results of the early scientific imagination, clockwork machinery, advanced agriculture and horticulture methods, and most importantly for Mumford’s argument, water and wind power. Because of the naturally distributed nature of this energy source, innovation took on a deeply heterogeneous character: you might find three radically different windmill or watermill prototypes just miles away along the Rhine. The political economy of this time in Europe is a complex issue, but one might notice that this period corresponds to the last stand of the landed peasantry and the existence of the commons before the Enclosure movements of the late 17th and 18th century.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The next period, called “paleotechnic,” is one of centralization and reinvigorated state power, again determined by a dominant energy source and its effect on production:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cblockquote>\n\u003Cp>The so‐called “Industrial Revolution,” in conventional parlance, conflates two distinct phenomena: the development of mechanized processes for specific kinds of production (spinning and weaving, in particular), and the harnessing of the steam engine as a prime mover. The former was a direct outgrowth of the mechanical science of the eotechnic phase, and would have been fully compatible with production in the small shop if not for the practical issues raised by steam power. The imperative to concentrate machine production in large factories resulted, not from the requirements of machine production as such, but from the need to economize on steam power.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/blockquote>\n\u003Cp>You can see where this is going: the concentration of productive capacities, the emphasis on extractivism and mercantilism, the East India Trading Company, the pollution and cutthroat capitalism of 19th century Western Europe are all sprouted from this initial mobilization around an expensive and concentrated energy capacity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Mumford’s third stage dates to the late nineteenth century, the \u003Cstrong>neotechnic\u003C/strong>, an “electricity and alloy complex” to replace the rule of coal and iron. And with it, the potential for \u003Cstrong>a restoration of autonomy and decentralized production\u003C/strong>, the dampening of state power. Carson notes that this period roughly corresponds to the writing of the utopian mutualist anarchist Peter Kropotkin. The neotechnic phase was a continuation of the heterogeneity and distributed innovation of the eotechnic period, even implying a “marriage of town and country, of industry and agriculture” (Mumford) as horticultural innovation could flourish on the same level as technologically emboldened workshop and village innovation. Refined tools for the circulation of information could mean diverse branches of innovation aiding and multiplying each other.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As Carson notes, much in line with Michel Bauwens’ work on \u003Ca href=\"https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Sources_of_P2P_Theory\">peer production\u003C/a>, these utopian tools of decentralized technological power are now well developed. And yet, from the perspective of Technics and History, we still live in the long eighteenth century - the neotechnic toolkit remains underutilized (except by urban and rural pioneers of autonomy of the type cities like Portland and Berlin know well). More importantly, the political exit from extractivist and centralized regimes has not caught up with the liberatory capacities of the neotechnic energy paradigm.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Under the executive sovereignty of an 81 year old president, we seem to live in the dead shell of an obsolete power system. But, as all technological optimists know, regimes of production and coordination have the power to leave behind unjust and insufficient political structures. Whither Target, down with the banks. \u003Cstrong>We are the neotechnics, and we will decentralize across scales!\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>“WE ARE THE NEOTECHNICS!”\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>—\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Portland is home to a robust underground infrastructure of local-scale production capacities. We say underground because you can walk right by these warehouses and minor complexes, full of hardware hackers and woodshops, CNC machines and welding stations without noticing. To illustrate, here is a rough map, stripped of names, of spaces we are aware of with some or all of these capacities, offered cheap or freely and run at a community level:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SystE8q26.jpg\" alt=\"pdxdmakermap2\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One thing we notice hanging out in these spaces is how familiar to the web3 spirit their members are.

(As one welder told us while building a cargo bike, ‘when I have my head in a project, I’m not thinking about other people’s shit.’) They haven’t bridged the gap from personal economy to political economy because they haven’t discovered the coordination infrastructure to scale. \u003Cstrong>Maybe that’s where web3 comes in.\u003C/strong>\u003C/p>",{"headings":359,"localImagePaths":360,"remoteImagePaths":361,"frontmatter":350,"imagePaths":362},[],[],[],[],"We Are the Neotechnics.md","what-is-ethereum-localism",{"id":364,"data":366,"body":370,"filePath":371,"digest":372,"rendered":373,"legacyId":380},{"title":367,"date":368,"summary":14,"banner":369,"draft":16},"What is Ethereum Localism?","2024-06-29","/images/whatisethereumlocalism.png","When we first suggested the theme of Ethereum Localism in anticipation of the GFEL conference, it was a totally open ended provocation, meant to stir up a diversity of interpretations.

In it, we attempt to explain the behavior of the underground through the lens of the virtual, a philosophical concept for the real and materially embedded trace of potential that exists within or perhaps alongside the world of proper things. This trace is articulated in a polyphonic voice, laden with indeterminacy and subtlety. It resists mechanization. To perceive and generatively engage with it requires an atmosphere of nonviolence and open experimentation. For these reasons, it is anathema to institutions.* \n\n*We propose to understand the behavior and strategic uniformity of the underground as the accumulation of spontaneous tactics for avoiding violent and mechanistic systems in order to approach, in a wide range of cultural forms, the virtual. Once established, we suggest a path forward to formalize economic systems around this underground intuition, proposing virtual capital as an orienting and generative frame for real economic games. Because it is expressed in intersubjective & relational fields rather than classical objects, building economic systems that prioritize virtual capital could require an overhaul of design thinking analogous to the overhaul of classical physics for the indeterminate field-mechanics of quantum physics. To cognize these forms may require an ontological ordeal, a conversion (of which there are many rumors in recent years). Lucky for us, we have the strategic intuition of the underground to follow, a world of intensive value we call undercapital.* \n\n# **Undercapital: The Extitutional Life of Value**\n\n“*Money institutionalizes a social relation—or, rather, a set of relations of social production and reproduction.*” - Michael Hardt & Antonio Negri, ***Assembly***\n\n[Our previous piece](https://mirror.xyz/openprotocolresearch.eth/YuZvCx5ge2nQXo8L2n0iWKN_CflivaCfsoLNMoVTqf4) took us underground, to spaces where direct and participatory access to the aesthetic environment reigned and the injunction was free association within robust contexts of affirmative consent. We went looking for these core underground values, but we discovered along with them living zones where alien forms of capital dwelled: in the 1980’s underground LSD market, the abandoned warehouses and open valleys of the UK free party scene, the bedrooms of deviants and sadomasochists, the two variables from which all the participatory action was shaped seemed to be consent and *atmosphere*.  In a footnote, we were compelled to propose a ninth form of capital: virtual capital, the sense of potential, the empowering penumbra or haze of objects and entities as they verge on the edge of what is to come. \n\nThe philosopher and translator Brian Massumi may be the major contemporary scholar of the virtual, a key concept in the work of Gilles Deleuze and a key proto-concept or theme in work of the natural philosopher Henri Bergson. Consider Massumi on Bergson’s reading of Zeno’s paradox: “*When Zeno shoots his philosophical arrow, he thinks of its flight path in the commonsense way, as a linear trajectory made up of a sequence of points or positions that the arrow occupies one after the other. The problem is that between one point on a line and the next, there is an infinity of intervening points. lf the arrow occupies a first point along its path, it will never reach the next-unless it occupies each of the infinity of points between. Of course, it is the nature of infinity that you can never get to the end of it. The arrow gets swallowed up in the transitional infinity. Its flight path implodes. The arrow is immobilized.*”\n\nBergson takes Zeno’s paradox as a gesture to a dimension of reality that can’t be understood on the representational plane - an element of immanent continuity or in-itselfness that can’t be broken up into component measurables. For Massumi, these different modes of reality can be thought of as “intensive” and “extensive.” The arrival of the arrow at its target testifies to the intensive nature of its trajectory:\n\n “*Extensive space, and the arrested objects occupying the positions into which it is divisible, is a back-formation from cessation. The dynamic enabling the back-formation is \"intensive\" in the sense that movement, in process, cannot be determinately indexed to anything outside of itself. It has withdrawn into an all-encompassing relation with what it will be. lt is in becoming, absorbed in occupying its field of potential.*” [1]  \n\nElsewhere, we have referred to the prefigurative circle, borrowed from anarchist politics, where means and ends are fused. In the underground web space, we sometimes call this an “infinite game,” a game with no intention of ending, played for the pleasure of itself. In philosophical terms, you could say that the *telos* of such a game is fused with the process, or the process itself is the *telos*. The intensive is like a metaphysical extension of this logic: the world of entities seen as they gesturally embody their potential, beneath any singular embodiment. Bergson thought of it as an object in *duration* rather than linear time; those well-versed in certain spiritual traditions might think of it as the “subtle body” of an object or environment. [2] Practically, this points us in the right direction: perceiving and being affected by this dimension requires a patience or subtlety, and a peace. \n\nIt’s our claim that this “intensive” reality of things in their becoming is the object of the underground, the organizing principle for its many disparate articulations. Of course, to speak of “the underground” is already to assume a unity. In the previous piece, we called it “the protocol underground” to emphasize strategic patterns that come from lack of access to institutional sanction. Here, we look at it from the underside: protocolization as a strategy of flight, avoidance of institutional sanction in pursuit of the thing that institutional presence diminishes or destroys. This thing is anathema to violence, and to mechanization; it requires a patience and willingness to hazard the far reaches of subjectivity. It is only experienced through an *intersubjective ordeal*, attention in a state of withdrawn ego. (What’s it feel like? A transpersonal swell of electricity in your spine.) We call this intensive field or substance “the virtual.”\n\n\n## The Virtual\n\nThe virtual is a peculiar term, ripe for misinterpretation, especially in the context of the web. The philosopher Levi R. Bryant does as good of a job as any of explaining its nuance, and is worth quoting at length.  \n\n“*…virtual is not to be confused with virtual reality. The latter is generally treated as a simulacrum of reality, as a sort of false or computer generated reality. By contrast, the virtual is entirely real without, for all that, being actual. The term “virtuality” comes from the Latin virtus, which has connotations of potency and efficacy. As such, the virtual, as virtus, refers to powers and capacities belonging to an entity. And in order for an entity to have powers or capacities, it must actually exist. In this connection, while the virtual refers to potentiality, it would be a mistake to conflate this potentiality with the concept of a potential object. A potential object is an object that does not exist but which could come to exist. By contrast, the virtual is strictly a part of a real and existing object. The virtual consists of the volcanic powers coiled within an object.*”   \n\nLet’s take this foundation and continue into some orienting statements, unlocked with some attention to potential areas of resonance with or relevance to the underground: \n\n#### The virtual is “real but not actual.” \nDeleuze once called himself a “transcendental empiricist,” interested in disruptions to the subject-object paradigm (transcendental moments) only to the extent that they were available to direct sensible experimentation, i.e., that they were real. The virtual is an insistently materialist or physicalist concept: though it may refer to experiential fields that have often been associated with the supernatural, it places them squarely on the plane of nature. Concertgoers, artists, sex lovers or even athletes are familiar with this order of substance that is difficult to talk about, but palpable, there to be encountered by all participants who would hazard to enter into an intersubjective key. [3] When the participants fail to reach the critical mass of this delicate recursion, its absence seems equally palpable, felt independently by all in the room. There are times in history where its assertive reality changes the course of events dramatically (try a quick search of The Mute Girl of Portici, 1830). \n\n#### The virtual expresses objects and entities in their multiplicity. \nContinuing on with the common notions of this crowd-cognizance of the virtual, consider the refrain heard over and over again to describe such notable events (or scenes, or summers…): “*At that moment, it felt like anything was possible.*” If you asked someone who made this claim what exactly was possible, what would they say? In our reading, the phrase pushes against its own grammar. Its referent is not any given thing, but *anything*, the irreducible multiplicity, the potential expressed in its intensive plurality, not at all in the service of the actual. For both Bergson and Deleuze, it is the submersion in time, the intractable blurriness of duration that affords it this freedom. And duration can’t be abstracted.  *Sorry - you just had to be there.*  \n\n#### Relation to the virtual entails a marriage of means and ends. \nThe virtual loathes representation or commercialization, half-baked metaphors or morality tales: because it is prefigurative and intensive in nature, it stands only for itself. Any teenager can tell the difference between the cultural products of focus groups (or the tv series scripts of grad students) and the eccentric or disturbed creativity of those who bothered to turn off the faucet of means and ends; who ventured to listen to the “penumbra” silence of the material world in ordert to create an honest and self-contained impersonal expression that  “cannot be determinately indexed to anything outside of itself.” Outside of the instrumentalizing imperatives of institutions, the actual that is produced can be grounded in the savage and pluralistic vectors of the plane of nature. \n\nTake the nineteenth century critic John Ruskin’s description of the gothic builders, who he argues must have been “altogether set free” given their rude and obstinate creations, \"creations of ungainly shape and rigid limb, but full of wolfish life.\" [4] He saw in their disturbed, gargoyle eccentricity \"a profound sympathy with the fulness and wealth of the material universe.\" Their imagination appears conjured from the stone, a materialist imagination, gained not by imposition but by a transpersonal ordeal and a negotiation with the material conditions before them. We see it in the psychedelic and nonsymbolic color-codes of Edgar Allen Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death,” the barely melodic screams of Diamanda Galas, Sun Ra’s space outfits, Robert Chamber’s Yellow King: raw visceral expression that is anything but metaphor, a record of a material encounter beyond objects.\n\n#### The virtual is available to strategy and formalization even as it remains resistant to standardization. \nAs we have seen in the “two squeezes method” of Jay Wiseman’s s/m manual outlined in the [previous essay](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/Open-Protocol-Research-Group/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground), undergrounds have been known to generate detailed strategies for attaining access to the virtual. To say that mechanization or instrumentalization by standardized regimes results in harsh diminishment of the virtual is not to say that some manner of repeated protocolization isn’t needed. The protocol underground is nothing but these intergenerational and cultural strategies for engaging the intensive. (As we will see later, these *open protocols* differ from institutional ones insomuch as, rather than dealing with objects and atoms, they are oriented toward a field or phase space, a polyvocal order-of-things full of divergence and indeterminacy.)   \n\nThe virtual, in brief, is a real and powerful dimension of the material world, but it appears phantom to many because it does not correlate with naked subjects. To relate to it and be empowered by it depends on a porousness in one’s individuality, an unthought, known as much to craftsmen and athletes as to religious mystics and artists. In the realm of institutions, whether nationalist, commercial, religious, we see its power captured and chained to brands, figureheads, flags, sentimental imaginals far removed from the eccentricity and in-itselfness of the plane of nature. It is beholden to a *telos*, always something or someone else’s end: mystified, antireal, rooted in domination. The underground, in the accumulated, impersonal intentionality of its designs, asserts the autonomy, ubiquity, and democracy of the virtual.\n\nAn underground value-accounting of the virtual as a ninth form of capital would need to somehow follow this prefigurative circle. It would seek to expand rather than reduce and control. As we have learned from the underground, this means asserting a savage and uncaptured pacifism, defiance of the tendency of violence (especially hidden or implied, Graeber’s ‘structural violence’) to drain the atmosphere, divorce means from ends and fill the room with anti-aura of rigid persons and things. Take us literally when we say that the objects in a space withdrawal their power when supremacy is in the room. “Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough” [5] - the inverse is true. The underground long since moved this knowledge from poetic insight to actionable process. The decentralized web can iterate into this mode, join forces, become underground. But, in the tradition of design pragmatism - the rational inspiration that informed the eight forms framework in Gregory Landua and Ethan Roland’s ***Regenerative Enterprise*** - it must do so in unsuperstitious aspect.\n\nThe prefigurative virtual: its stakes are no less real for being “vague”. [6] Establish peace, find an impersonal attention, die a little, and watch the room awaken around you. Deep roots sprouting. This is intersubjective power. How to formalize it?\n\n## Open Protocols & Peaceful Money\n\nThe Open Protocol Research Group and Ethereal Forest have, across our work and investigations, hinted at a generalized autonomism (independence from structures of legitimate violence) and toward legitimacy by other means. In the case of crypto, this takes the form of thermodynamically or mathematically secured cryptographic “hardness.” [7] In the analogue realm, communities of intersubjective trust (what Austin Wade Smith once called “epi-consent”) fill this same role. It is the underground thesis of web3 adoption that the two could be weaved together by the protocolized structures of decentralized and emergent legitimacy - strategies that both have discovered, as a matter of prefigurative necessity. Open protocolization is the structural bridge, peaceful autonomy is the deep value that buttresses it. \n\nWhat becomes clear from the investigation into the underground, the realm of open protocols, is that it is the very process of relating to the virtual that makes the open protocol thesis work. Recall the definition: open protocols are “social and technical protocols woven together into a compound cultural protocol of improvisational, empirical imagination.” This “atmosphere” of divergence and open empiricism, the enthusiasm for the intersubjective field, is what lends open protocols the viral memetic power to circulate in the underground. They are programmed with its real effects. If, as Massumi writes, “the surplus of reality that constitutes the virtual guarantees the gift of freedom granted to the actual,” open protocols are empowered by the freedom of actualization. \n\nAnd yet, there remains this final boss of institutionalization, virally decentralized and free floating, that aspires to enter into every relationship and divorce means and ends. “Money designates and reproduces a specific social structure,” write Hardt & Negri. “Money *institutionalizes* a social relation—or, rather, a set of relations of social production and reproduction.” The underground finds itself in a double bind inasmuch as the resources needed for social relations to reproduce themselves are tethered to a mechanism for divorcing means and ends. The capacities of money - the unit of account, the means of exchange, the store of value - are not institutional in and of themselves, but their particular configuration in the arbitrary and violently conditioned order of *fiat*. \n\nIn no way is this group endorsing the abolition of money, even in its current form; fiat, or something that looks like it, will continue to have important use cases, especially as an “exit value” from the geographical and contextual locales invoked below. In the outside and interstitial spaces of these locales, there is room for a non-institutional form of it. But as as long as the whole index of value forms is systematically subjugated to the rule of financial capital - as long as the circulation of resources is directed toward the supernaturalist myopia of profit-in-itself - autonomist relationships will be systematically diminished and marginalized. What is needed, if we are reading the landscape correctly, is an extitutional or underground account of capital that could think both autonomy and the virtual that autonomy affords access to. \n\nMassumi himself, along with colleague Erin Manning, took a shot at an expression of extitutional capital in their collaborations with the Economic Space Agency. [8] We encourage any reader to explore the Three Ecologies Institute and the 3E Process Seed Bank. It’s our feeling that these efforts were partially compromised by the institutional conditions of their emergence. (Consider the title of this article on SenseLab, of which 3EI is an outgrowth: “Philosophy Can Be  a Living Process: Inside Senselab’s Radically Interdisciplinary Graduate Research Culture.”) We’ll let the graduate students enjoy their Temporary Autonomous Zones within the university walls. But the highest stake projects in the “revaluation of value” are not to be found, in our opinion, in the isolation of art projects funded by university endowment funds. \n\nTo forge a new direction, we propose an encounter with the extant models of altereconomic creativity, circulating open protocols of the underground that orbit the virtual as both the memetic fuel for their reproduction and the end goal of their operations. They work at a different level of extitutional clarity, being “located” in ephemeral pop up efforts, occasional excitations of what is properly a field of pluralistic and technological improvisation. Insomuch as the Open Protocol Research Group and our extitutional affiliates remain without institutional affiliation - inasmuch as DAOs are mere excitations of an ecosystem substrate with always porous boundaries and prefigurative ends - we may have the right eyes to develop practical concepts from this clarity. And potentially, given enough patience and receptivity, to weave those concepts into the field. \n\n\n## undercapital\n\nWhat’s ultimately at play in this research vector is the distinction between enumerating the virtual -  instrumentalizing it to the end of indexed quantity - and extracting or “expressing” from it operational passages that can expand or formalize prefiguration. We must, as we say, *formalize without standardizing*.\n\n**Undercapital** is the combinatorial problem space - the sum of operational passages - of the eight forms of capital and the three faculties of money when deployed toward the expansion of the virtual field. This takes the form of a literal matrix of possible combinations of these forms, but it does so in a peculiar way: because the virtual field expands under prefigurative conditions, the submersion of the various forms into themselves, even individually, produces the virtual as a positive externality (just as a swordmaker, in the transpersonal process of gaining artful expertise in the craft, discovers an instance of the virtual animating his steels). When realist conditions are present - peace in the absence of institutional regimes, consent, fluency in intersubjective physics - the virtual is abundant. \n\nAnd if undercapital is oriented by the wealth of the virtual that accompanies it, we know which way the ship sails: This is the same wealth that give substance and reproductive capacity to open protocols, inasmuch as they diminish the need for institutions. Encoded in their strategies of open use and propagation is an assertion of the open field of (empirical) possibility as an end in itself. To this extent, the stakes of undercapital are entangled with a structural attitude of p2p and stigmeric coordination, and protocolization as a free formalization of any would be “standard.”  \n\nStill, the question remains of value flow: if open protocols are the path forward, what kind of economic games could push toward a tipping of the scale in the direction of protocolization? If extitutions (defined in previous work as outposts of open protocols that feign institutional legibility but whose behavior is only understood in an open protocol framework) are needed to expand the reach of open protocols, how can they be integrated into systems of multicapital provisioning that avoid financialization?\n\nExperimental efforts to multiply the forms of capital that people organize themselves around have an accomplished history that we can learn from. Every city has their local coups. For our town of Portland, one of the most significant coups is the decades-old initiative the Rebuilding Center. They followed the following steps to scale to surprising influence and persistence in the urban bazaar:  \n\n1. **Develop a concept of multicapital wealth.** Practical necessity, circulated frameworks or a stroke of community inspiration leads to a concept on the community level of collaboratively produced or commonly-held wealth and a concept of community autonomy is formed.\n    \n2. **Accumulation of multicapital resources** by way of unlocking latent stores - of which, because of impoverished frameworks that ignore the holism of the eight forms, there are many.  In the case of Rebuilding Center, this was simple stores of imperfect or difficult to resell housing materials including cabinets, fixtures, structural components. Once recognized, those who possess them tend to be empowered and energized by the realization of their direct autonomous access to important stores of wealth, and step 1 is emboldened.\n    \n3. **Develop a protocol of sustainable and effective resource allocation.** This involves everything from community governance (esp. when the resource being allocated is based in living capital, i.e. cultural and social) to navigating the revenue evil curve. Rebuilding Center was able to reach a “flow state” of legitimacy that allowed it to receive enough consistent volunteer labor to be sustainable.\n    \n4. **Institutional legitimacy and state subsidies.** Because of the networked nature of multicapital initiatives, siloed departments of “environmental protection” and “racial equity” often flock to aid the autonomous initiative, once it is up and running. (The second order effects are intersectional because the direct access to multicapital wealth cuts across multiple systems of exploitation.) Most important to the formula is the way in which the autonomous capacity of the initiative allows for an expansion of the Overton Window of what constitutes acceptable public action. [9]\n    \nThis playbook (a common roadmap for the most extitutionally oriented nonprofits) constitutes a field-tested strategy for staving off the worst elements of standardization and scaling more or less on the community’s own terms and within patterns that light the way to autonomy from the instrumental reign of financial profit. Being a large, multiple city block-sized brick and mortar outfit, the rigorous correspondence to a range of regulatory and financial standards was an unavoidable need for RC. But it may be the case that undercapital initiatives can’t follow this path.\n\nIt seems uncontroversial to those familiar with underground communities that undergrounds simply do not scale. This insight is usually delivered with a superstitious air or a veteran’s cynicism: “nothing good in this world can last.” It’s important to internalize this field knowledge, but it is for us realists to reject any tendency to quietism and supernaturalism: as Massumi and Deleuze show us, the virtual is *real* if not actual. It’s expression is akin to the probabilistic fields of post-Newtonian physics: we can design around these real elements so long as we consider them not as particles, quantities, objects, but as the distributed likelihood of a visitation. And we know - or rather we can learn - what increases the likelihood.\n\nConsider the three major elements of undergrounds identified in the previous essay: The mutual assumption of high agency. A robust culture of informed and affirmative consent. A participatory and pluralistic aesthetic. In a word, the charge of the virtual, the *stuff* of the underground, depends upon conditions of inter-agency, whereas the modes of consumption common to institutional spaces depend upon a learned passivity or complacency and a commercially or administratively driven taste for homogeneity. For scaling undergrounds, this makes for (at least) three specific barriers:\n\n1. **Institutional-behavioral bias.** In the United States, we have a complex and multilayered bureaucratic regime of licensed specialization, as well as a deeply cynical culture of litigious opportunism bolstered by a professional class of legal professionals. This puts consumers and owners in what Slate Star Codex famously called a “multipolar trap,” a downward spiral of paralysis before mutually interwoven elements that are, in their sum, oppressive.  Participatory patterns of high agency and active rather than consumptive aesthetic creation suffocate under standards optimized - or regulatorily disciplined into - a low agency logic.\n    \n2. **Limits to circulation of underground protocols.** Similarly, large scale operations attract low agency participants, and in particular participants who are not sophisticated enough in strategies of affirmative consent and negotiated intersubjectivity to be able to attend to the needs of the atmosphere. Underground activities require cultural or placed-based specificity, what Ven calls “the contextual/geographical local” i.e. a scene or a neighborhood - in order to meaningfully develop and sustain the characteristics of a high agency public. When it sees a scene scale beyond this local specificity, the virtual flees with both feet.\n    \n3. **Cult of personality.** Perhaps the most delicate feature of undergrounds, the one that breaks the most quickly when scaling, are their headlessness. The specter of a cult of personality is wonderfully destructive in two senses: the ability of outsiders to identify a literal or figurative locus of liability, a scapegoat, which it can “coopt, kill or imprison” (in the case of artistic movements, this is almost always cooptation or self-destruction); the tendency for elements in the community to elevate a locus of energy that they can *withdraw agency* to (in this way, the cult of personality reflects in one breath the worst tendencies of problem 1 & 2).\n    \nThere’s a contradiction latent in the question of scaling communities of the virtual insomuch as the virtual is a facet of material contingency. Think of it as a moving image of potential manifestations produced by a given material to show, for the benefit of those who have bothered to encounter it, its singularity. For a shopping complex, an acre of land is an acre of land: the environments of communities of the virtual enjoy no such fungibility. In a passage of some of his earliest reflections on the virtual from Difference and Repetition (1968), Deleuze writes: \n\n*For the nature of the virtual is such that, for it, to be actualised is to be differenciated. Each differenciation is a local integration or a local solution which then connects with others in the overall solution or the global integration. This is how, in the case of the organic, the process of actualisation appears simultaneously as the local differenciation of parts, the global formation of an internal milieu, and the solution of a problem posed within the field of constitution of an organism. An organism is nothing if not the solution to a problem, as are each of its differenciated organs, such as the eye which solves a light 'problem'; but nothing within the organism, no organ, would be differenciated without the internal milieu endowed with a general effectivity or integrating power of regulation.* \n\nNote that the organism is not a metaphor here: this divergent actualization occurs across scales, and is as true of organisms as well as geographies, languages, cultures. The nuance between actualization and the virtual itself is admittedly a difficult one, but we can note that organisms, languages, geographies, enrich and intensify the field of real possibles: the stakes, then, of the need for the local to “connect with others” is the persistence and expansion of the material trace which creates more intensity, more dense potential. They become an organism so they can persist in difference. \n\nAlready in \"[Sketches](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/Open-Protocol-Research-Group/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground)” we’ve seen the illicit underground discover, out of necessity, a strategy of open protocolization resistant to the three barriers to scaling. To preserve underground values and subvert the key mechanistic depressions of the virtual field, they scaled horizontally in a way that was culturally and technically headless. But their rebuttal to the supernaturalists comes at a cost: with each instance of horizontal scaling comes a fracturing of coherence, a *difference*: to persist, they sacrifice a body, diffusing like a mist (or hardening into cooptations, *giving up the ghost* as it were). \n\nThe strategic problem space of undercapital, of the formalizable potential systems of an overground society of the virtual, is how to take advantage of this drift, how to alchemize it from “local” degradation to global enrichment: a “*general effectivity*” or integrating power. In the case of Deleuze’s body, “*no organ would be differenciated without the internal milieu endowed with a general effectivity*.” Are the disparate cells capable of operation totally separate from the milieu? Only insofar as they can survive without resources (not very far). They’re viable difference is contingent on their relation to the unity of the body. If undergrounds die - or if we often offer experience undergrounds in their fleetingness, in a persistent dying - it would seem to be because they lack a concept of *general effectivity*, a notion of commonness with the autonomous and horizontally scaling “differenciations”. So what would be the contours of this “general effectivity,” this body?\n\n## A note on the category of art\n\nSo far much of our reflection on the underground has been reduced to the so-called “arts” It strikes us that the label “art” is a strategy for compartmentalizing and mollifying what should rightfully be a primary tension in our society, even greater than that of class. A common refrain, “She makes it into an *art form*,” would seem to signal both deference and mild condescension: she goes too far, aestheticizes it too much, *she's an accountant for Christ’s sake*. This signals to us that many fields are pregnant with the stilted excess of deep material engagement. Beyond logistical comprehension is material knowledge, and deep material knowledge is (again) an intersubjective and ontologically challenging ordeal. \n\nIf the arts provide countless examples of rhizomatic free association indexed against dynamic and locally contingent material and technical conditions, they are only a prefiguration of a material inspiration that might consume all sectors. *Art is a fallacy, we all must become artists.* Or rather, the underground is ubiquitous inasmuch as many of us are all already artists, engaging with local virtuals, seeing through (or more accurately, seeing *with*) the garden or the refurbished bookshelf, whatever we have cared to deeply know in its own expression, to the multiplicity it contains.\n\n\n## Actualizing Undercapital\n\nThe question of undercapital, the mobilization of the eight forms of capital and the three faculties of money to the expansion of the virtual field, is also the question of constructing a body from these pluralistic and multiscale social forms through which nutritive resources can be circulated: what Spinoza calls “a common notion.”   \n\nOne could argue that the virtual, by virtue of its immeasurability, is anathema to design, planning or global conceptualization. It seems to be the general opinion of the zeitgeist, for the moment. As materialists, we can’t help call this out as fallacy: we are merely entering the era where relational fields must be privileged over objects/particles, where a new type of planning needs to be conceptualized in reference to a probabilistic rather than quantitative index. Fields are real, they are just of a different order of causality. Undercapital asks: *How can we develop economic games that relate to intersubjective fields?*  \n\nFor a first target, the low-hanging fruit is open protocolization itself. Undercapital enthusiasts can fund pop-up think tanks that work to solve, in a given context (any given context, at any scale), problems like the following:  \n  \n#### How can a protocol be employed to intensive ends? \nConsider the work done to adapt LSD from a DoD mind control initiative to a tool for exploring the intersubjective field (“Turn on, Tune in, Drop out”). We have discussed at length how certain technologies of reuse and repair or small scale food production have been honed in the direction of autonomy from centralized systems. What manner of creative divergence comes from those who go to their garden rather than the CVS, who depend on their knowledge in a craft over their appetite for consumerism to fix a problem of sustenance? \n\nLike the free parties discussed in the first post, in some cases the journey might be greater than the destination. The labor intensive nature of autonomous action generates the positive externality of deep material engagement, just as deep material engagement often generates the positive externality of autonomy. Other practices at the level of the individual and below might be encoded that could add further positive externalities, ones which the individuals themselves could benefit form. The virtual takes care of its own. \n\n#### How can protocols stack to maximize each other’s capacities?  \nThe multiscale character of the virtual is a rich design vector: open protocols for seeding ubiquitous local gardens, results themselves of a caring transpersonal ordeal, could scale the viability of autonomous pharmaceutical experiments that lead to new horizons of non-normal states. A renaissance of garage manufacturing and hardware hacking could develop into regional or even neighborhood aesthetic vernaculars, communities erupting in swells of participatory agency over their environment. As in the case of the multi-capital initiatives mentioned earlier, formalized strategies for encountering the virtual generate second order effects that diminish institutions and encourage material curiosity, open empiricism, intersubjectvie games. The virtual is the subliminal means by which a general autonomism could go viral. \n    \n#### What are the contours of Minimal Viable Evasion? \nThe regulatory authority of the state acts on always shifting ground, push and pull regimes of emphasis and favor. Undergrounds, especially urban undergrounds are well aware of the many areas where non-enforcement is a de facto policy. Despite stereotypes, it would appear to us that law enforcement in underfunded urban locales are often willing to ignore a peaceful good time so long as the participants have done due diligence with neighbors and other local stakeholders. The problem comes when large scale commercial or public interests are significantly threatened, especially when it comes to legal liability. Kyle Smith at LexDAO has invoked “inverted precedent,” potential legal engineering tactics for establishing autonomous contracts that would be recognized by the state. How can these be combined with known underground tactics for staying under the radar of enforcement to generate passable strategies for the kind of participatory and experimental gatherings needed for group encounters with the virtual?  \n\nEphemeral open protocol DAOs might pop up for six weeks or six months to accomplish deep research in the extant tactics and the new technological strategies available, contribute it to the strategic lexicon (an open protocol library like the one being established at Open Civics), and dissolve. Members of our community are already working on forking Protocol Guilds self-curated registries in order to establish vehicles for flowing resources to researchers who prioritize protocolization as a means of supporting and maintaining the extitutional clarity of the underground.\n\n\n## Token Engineering\n\nInasmuch as communities that are oriented toward the virtual field take the shape of this fragmented milieu, the clearest path for formalizing value flows in their direction is to establish network effects by way of an economic grammar for common cause. Can reputation tokens be deployed to solve scaling problem number two, the circulation of protocols and etiquette for high agency participation? Individuals could establish peer legitimacy in one scene and use it as entry to another - no need for one standard, they could be pluralistic - but in our view the dynamics of surveillance and implications of “social credit score” would do more harm to the prospect of intersubjective ordeals than it would benefit the scaling problem.   \n\nCommunity reputation tokens would invert the logic - they could be used to solicit resources, encouraging high agency participants to engage new scenes while leaving it to the scenes themselves to maintain a vertical limit to scaling (an important engine of horizontal differenciation) corresponding to the physics of underground etiquette or ‘epi-consent.’ These may, however, be contradictory inputs: generally, the key strategy for preserving epi-consent is to remain opaque to the general public. The design game amounts to a rivalrous balance between social capital and virtual capital, the hazards of public legibility to the maintenance of the vibe.\n\nThe desired path would seem to require a negotiation between the two: some level of minimum viable reputation token to allow trusted participants to signal that a locale meets a given rubric of the underground - most of all robust consent protocols and institutional disaffiliation - mixed with a zero knowledge architecture for dispersing funds to a burner address for a scene without requiring public visibility of that scene.  Guerilla funders could send fleets of high trust auditors into the global underground to jumpstart resource flows, signaling across months to generate a registry in which _something_ cool is happening, who knows what?(This would require fairly elaborate legal engineering that we think are nonetheless viable.) A side effect of this scene-anonymous resource share is a collective underconsciousness of the underground, a knowledge that a tide is rising, and access to resources are no longer contingent on institutional legibility.  \n\nStill, these designs are trapped within a logic of *financial capital allocation* between *discrete entities*. Undercapital design gets much more savage when tracing multicapital and multifunctional allocation techniques across horizontally expanding threads of the underground, defined not in terms of discrete entities - not even primarily extitutions - but protocols and fields. When material labor becomes de-institutionalized, tinged with affect and virtual life, are its products scarce in the same way? Cultural, experiential and intellectual capital, the key substances of (socio-)technical open protocols, may have the power to render the other forms abundant in a way that deemphasizes traditional economic scarcity. What then?  \n\nIt’s hard to say what is science fiction and what is a direct material path forward - that is the work of an undercapital analysis that could take years to unfold. Yet open protocolization and the viral adoption of virtually grounded autonomous labor could unfold into a runaway complementarity at any time. Our engineering efforts should occupy that gap. What can dynamic issuance, bonding curves, self-curated registries and on-chain mutual credit mean for a first breath of an inverted city or cultural economy? As supermodular network effects outside of institutions grow into a common wealth, is some economic activity supplanted by a highly engaged tokenized commons governance that mirrors the polycentric and ever-forking structure of the open protocols? \n\n\n## A memetic frame for a ‘general effectivity’ of the virtual\n\nMany cultures have a festival of the liminal - All Hallows Eve, Fet Gede, Día de los muertos, Gaelic Samhain, Walpurgis Night, the Hungry Ghost festival, days where the boundary between earth and the underworld is thin. They are at once utterly populist, but charged with gothic indulgences - spectors of “inorganic life”, atmospheric disorientation, a sense of coextensive realities - auric joys within a kind of folk mysticism of the earth. The literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin writes of the carnivalesque aura commonly associated with the folk underworld, as opposed to the solemn and guilt-ridden portrayals of institutional regimes. We'll quote him at length, from his *Problems of Dosteovsky’s Poetics*: what constitutes the carnivalesque? \n\n*Carnival is a pageant without footlights and without a division into performers and spectators. In carnival everyone is an active participant, everyone communes in the carnival act. Carnival is not contemplated and, strictly speaking, not even performed; its participants live in it, they live by its laws as long as those laws are in effect; that is, they live a carnivalistic life. Because carnivalistic life is life drawn out of its usual rut, it is to some extent \"life turned inside out,\" \"the reverse side of the world\" (\"monde al'envers\").*\n\n*The laws, prohibitions, and restrictions that determine the structure and order of ordinary, that is noncarnival, life are suspended during carnival: what is suspended first of all is hierarchical structure and all the forms of terror, reverence, piety, and etiquette connected with it ….*\n\n*Carnival is the place for working out, in a concretely sensuous, half-real and half-play-acted form, a new mode of interrelationship between individuals, counterposed to the all-powerful socio-hierarchical relationships of noncarnival life. The behavior, gesture, and discourse of a person are freed from the authority of all hierarchical positions (social estate, rank, age, property) defining them totally in noncarnival life, and thus from the vantage point of noncarnival life become eccentric and inappropriate. Eccentricity is a special category of the carnival sense of the world, organically connected with the category of familiar contact; it permits - in concretely sensuous form - the latent sides of human nature to reveal and express themselves.*\n\n*Linked with familiarization is a third category of the carnival sense of the world: carnivalistic mésalliances. A free and familiar attitude spreads over everything: over all values, thoughts, phenomena, and things. All things that were once self-enclosed, disunified, distanced from one another by a noncarnivalistic hierarchical worldview are drawn into carnivalistic contacts and combinations. Carnival brings together, unifies, weds, and combines the sacred with the profane, the lofty with the low, the great with the insignificant, the wise with the stupid.*\n\n*Connected with this is yet a fourth carnivalistic category, profanation: carnivalistic blasphemies, a whole system of carnivalistic debasings and bringings down to earth, carnivalistic obscenities linked with the reproductive power of the earth and the body, carnivalistic parodies on sacred texts and sayings, etc.*\n\nLater:\n\n*Carnival is past millennia's way of sensing the world as one great communal performance. This sense of the world, liberating one from fear, bringing the world maximally close to a person and bringing one person maximally close to another (everything is drawn into the zone of free familiar contact), with its joy at change and its joyful relativity, is opposed to that one-sided and gloomy official seriousness which is dogmatic and hostile to evolution and change, which seeks to absolutize a given condition of existence or a given social order.*\n\nAs we have seen, our undergrounds have far advanced from the folk wisdom of the crowd, adopting a design consciousness proper not to a common tourist but a seasoned traveller - and yet the germ of a cultural knowledge of the power of the virtual and the implications of contacting it is here in these age old features of the carnivalesque. They are a deep psychic heritage. \n\nCrypto has always carried with it a strange inversion, even paranoia: the integrity and immutability of the blockchain calls into question the integrity of all else, making the world a cauldron of potential relativity, propaganda, statecraft. The culture at large is at an extreme saturation of distrust for institutions, making for a living global carnival of AI infections, UFOs, snake oil salesmen of all types: the unipolar integrity of the post-Cold War period has fragmented into a million pieces. To the perspectival disorientation of the carnivalesque, the populous is well-initiated. Now they need to find orientation in that new cosmology.\n\nWe have long considered solidity devs, musicians, party alchemists, woodworkers, guerilla chemists, etc. to be kindred spirits in their dedication to “the craft.” The layer of psychonautic inquiry added to all of these material enterprises when one considers the _virtual field_ that flanks them gives the term “craft” a different sense entirely. A concept of the wisdom of astrology, tarot and witchcraft has passed over into the mainstream and is on the tip of everyone’s tongue.The folk underworld revival in our culture - significant since at least the seventies, but resurgent in the post-covid era - points to a desire for agency in the virtual field. What would it mean to extitutionalize this impulse, bring it over the material threshold, to circulate the notion that the spirits have always spoken most to experi- mentalists, makers and pirate empiricists who derive their mysticism not from the stars but from grounded expertise in the stone and the loom?\n\nIf crypto has a major cultural export, it’s the conviction we find in our international community that, by peaceful means, with tools won by careful attention and the seeking out of patterns of hardness in our ephemeral world, we can collectively design reality. What are the infrared colors\nand agencies of that coming real? Could the institutions even withstand a hypernaturalism, a mass awakening to an age of intensive or gothic materialism, where the only thing standing between us and a legion of alien agencies is our own autonomous labor?\n\n***\n\n [1] Bergson takes this impression of the intensive as far as an imperative in Creative Evolution: “We should no longer be asking where a moving body will be, what shape a system will take, through what state a change will pass at a given moment: the moments of time, which are only arrests of our attention, would no longer exist; it is the flow of time, it is the very flux of the real that we should be trying to follow.”\n\n[2] “An object is obviously not subjective. But if atmosphere is the elemental reality of the envelopment of potential surrounding and suffusing a locus of occurrent becoming, then objects have atmosphere. … This object, in addition to its sharpened functions, obscurely influences through the manner in which it carries a penumbra of alternatives whose edges will never be exhaustively charted. The feeling of the inexhaustibility of the object, in process and as propensity, is its aura: that by which it outdoes its utility and, more generally, exceeds intentionality…” (Massumi)\n\n[3] The [psychedelic sex scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a1AccLPeDk&pp=ygUbYmxhZGUgcnVubmVyIDIwNDkgc2V4IHNjZW5l) between K, Mariette and the disembodied Joi in Blade Runner 2049 seems to us to be an important visual or visceral approximation of the perception of the virtual.\n\n[4] John Ruskin, “[The Nature of the Gothic](https://homes.izmirekonomi.edu.tr/arch204/READINGS/02_RUSKIN.pdf)” in The Stones of Venice, Vol. II.\n\n[5] George Washington Carver.\n\n[6] “In any case, if the State always finds it necessary to repress the nomad and minor sciences, if it opposes vague essences and the operative geometry of the trait, it does so not because the content of these sciences is inexact or imperfect, or because of their magic or initiatory character, but because they imply a division of labor opposed to the norms of the State.” _A Thousand Plateaus_, 369.\n\n[7] See Josh Stark, “[Atoms, Institutions, Blockchains](https://stark.mirror.xyz/n2UpRqwdf7yjuiPKVICPpGoUNeDhlWxGqjulrlpyYi0)”\n\n[8] Find a profile on Massumi and Manning in Uriah Marc Todoroff, “[A Cryptoeconomy of Affect](https://thenewinquiry.com/a-cryptoeconomy-of-affect/)” in _The New Inquiry_.\n\n[9] Other radical multi-capital initiatives have taken the provocation of Overton as one of their main ends.

In it, we attempt to explain the behavior of the underground through the lens of the virtual, a philosophical concept for the real and materially embedded trace of potential that exists within or perhaps alongside the world of proper things. This trace is articulated in a polyphonic voice, laden with indeterminacy and subtlety. It resists mechanization. To perceive and generatively engage with it requires an atmosphere of nonviolence and open experimentation. For these reasons, it is anathema to institutions.\u003C/em> \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>We propose to understand the behavior and strategic uniformity of the underground as the accumulation of spontaneous tactics for avoiding violent and mechanistic systems in order to approach, in a wide range of cultural forms, the virtual. Once established, we suggest a path forward to formalize economic systems around this underground intuition, proposing virtual capital as an orienting and generative frame for real economic games. Because it is expressed in intersubjective &#x26; relational fields rather than classical objects, building economic systems that prioritize virtual capital could require an overhaul of design thinking analogous to the overhaul of classical physics for the indeterminate field-mechanics of quantum physics. To cognize these forms may require an ontological ordeal, a conversion (of which there are many rumors in recent years). Lucky for us, we have the strategic intuition of the underground to follow, a world of intensive value we call undercapital.\u003C/em> \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch1 id=\"undercapital-the-extitutional-life-of-value\">\u003Cstrong>Undercapital: The Extitutional Life of Value\u003C/strong>\u003C/h1>\n\u003Cp>“\u003Cem>Money institutionalizes a social relation—or, rather, a set of relations of social production and reproduction.\u003C/em>” - Michael Hardt &#x26; Antonio Negri, \u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>Assembly\u003C/strong>\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Ca href=\"https://mirror.xyz/openprotocolresearch.eth/YuZvCx5ge2nQXo8L2n0iWKN_CflivaCfsoLNMoVTqf4\">Our previous piece\u003C/a> took us underground, to spaces where direct and participatory access to the aesthetic environment reigned and the injunction was free association within robust contexts of affirmative consent. We went looking for these core underground values, but we discovered along with them living zones where alien forms of capital dwelled: in the 1980’s underground LSD market, the abandoned warehouses and open valleys of the UK free party scene, the bedrooms of deviants and sadomasochists, the two variables from which all the participatory action was shaped seemed to be consent and \u003Cem>atmosphere\u003C/em>.  In a footnote, we were compelled to propose a ninth form of capital: virtual capital, the sense of potential, the empowering penumbra or haze of objects and entities as they verge on the edge of what is to come. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The philosopher and translator Brian Massumi may be the major contemporary scholar of the virtual, a key concept in the work of Gilles Deleuze and a key proto-concept or theme in work of the natural philosopher Henri Bergson. Consider Massumi on Bergson’s reading of Zeno’s paradox: “\u003Cem>When Zeno shoots his philosophical arrow, he thinks of its flight path in the commonsense way, as a linear trajectory made up of a sequence of points or positions that the arrow occupies one after the other. The problem is that between one point on a line and the next, there is an infinity of intervening points. lf the arrow occupies a first point along its path, it will never reach the next-unless it occupies each of the infinity of points between. Of course, it is the nature of infinity that you can never get to the end of it. The arrow gets swallowed up in the transitional infinity. Its flight path implodes. The arrow is immobilized.\u003C/em>”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Bergson takes Zeno’s paradox as a gesture to a dimension of reality that can’t be understood on the representational plane - an element of immanent continuity or in-itselfness that can’t be broken up into component measurables. For Massumi, these different modes of reality can be thought of as “intensive” and “extensive.” The arrival of the arrow at its target testifies to the intensive nature of its trajectory:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp> “\u003Cem>Extensive space, and the arrested objects occupying the positions into which it is divisible, is a back-formation from cessation. The dynamic enabling the back-formation is “intensive” in the sense that movement, in process, cannot be determinately indexed to anything outside of itself. It has withdrawn into an all-encompassing relation with what it will be. lt is in becoming, absorbed in occupying its field of potential.\u003C/em>” [1]\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Elsewhere, we have referred to the prefigurative circle, borrowed from anarchist politics, where means and ends are fused. In the underground web space, we sometimes call this an “infinite game,” a game with no intention of ending, played for the pleasure of itself. In philosophical terms, you could say that the \u003Cem>telos\u003C/em> of such a game is fused with the process, or the process itself is the \u003Cem>telos\u003C/em>. The intensive is like a metaphysical extension of this logic: the world of entities seen as they gesturally embody their potential, beneath any singular embodiment. Bergson thought of it as an object in \u003Cem>duration\u003C/em> rather than linear time; those well-versed in certain spiritual traditions might think of it as the “subtle body” of an object or environment. [2] Practically, this points us in the right direction: perceiving and being affected by this dimension requires a patience or subtlety, and a peace. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s our claim that this “intensive” reality of things in their becoming is the object of the underground, the organizing principle for its many disparate articulations. Of course, to speak of “the underground” is already to assume a unity. In the previous piece, we called it “the protocol underground” to emphasize strategic patterns that come from lack of access to institutional sanction. Here, we look at it from the underside: protocolization as a strategy of flight, avoidance of institutional sanction in pursuit of the thing that institutional presence diminishes or destroys. This thing is anathema to violence, and to mechanization; it requires a patience and willingness to hazard the far reaches of subjectivity. It is only experienced through an \u003Cem>intersubjective ordeal\u003C/em>, attention in a state of withdrawn ego. (What’s it feel like? A transpersonal swell of electricity in your spine.) We call this intensive field or substance “the virtual.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"the-virtual\">The Virtual\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The virtual is a peculiar term, ripe for misinterpretation, especially in the context of the web. The philosopher Levi R. Bryant does as good of a job as any of explaining its nuance, and is worth quoting at length.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>“\u003Cem>…virtual is not to be confused with virtual reality. The latter is generally treated as a simulacrum of reality, as a sort of false or computer generated reality. By contrast, the virtual is entirely real without, for all that, being actual. The term “virtuality” comes from the Latin virtus, which has connotations of potency and efficacy. As such, the virtual, as virtus, refers to powers and capacities belonging to an entity. And in order for an entity to have powers or capacities, it must actually exist. In this connection, while the virtual refers to potentiality, it would be a mistake to conflate this potentiality with the concept of a potential object. A potential object is an object that does not exist but which could come to exist. By contrast, the virtual is strictly a part of a real and existing object. The virtual consists of the volcanic powers coiled within an object.\u003C/em>” \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Let’s take this foundation and continue into some orienting statements, unlocked with some attention to potential areas of resonance with or relevance to the underground: \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"the-virtual-is-real-but-not-actual\">The virtual is “real but not actual.”\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Deleuze once called himself a “transcendental empiricist,” interested in disruptions to the subject-object paradigm (transcendental moments) only to the extent that they were available to direct sensible experimentation, i.e., that they were real. The virtual is an insistently materialist or physicalist concept: though it may refer to experiential fields that have often been associated with the supernatural, it places them squarely on the plane of nature. Concertgoers, artists, sex lovers or even athletes are familiar with this order of substance that is difficult to talk about, but palpable, there to be encountered by all participants who would hazard to enter into an intersubjective key. [3] When the participants fail to reach the critical mass of this delicate recursion, its absence seems equally palpable, felt independently by all in the room. There are times in history where its assertive reality changes the course of events dramatically (try a quick search of The Mute Girl of Portici, 1830). \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"the-virtual-expresses-objects-and-entities-in-their-multiplicity\">The virtual expresses objects and entities in their multiplicity.\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Continuing on with the common notions of this crowd-cognizance of the virtual, consider the refrain heard over and over again to describe such notable events (or scenes, or summers…): “\u003Cem>At that moment, it felt like anything was possible.\u003C/em>” If you asked someone who made this claim what exactly was possible, what would they say? In our reading, the phrase pushes against its own grammar. Its referent is not any given thing, but \u003Cem>anything\u003C/em>, the irreducible multiplicity, the potential expressed in its intensive plurality, not at all in the service of the actual. For both Bergson and Deleuze, it is the submersion in time, the intractable blurriness of duration that affords it this freedom. And duration can’t be abstracted.  \u003Cem>Sorry - you just had to be there.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"relation-to-the-virtual-entails-a-marriage-of-means-and-ends\">Relation to the virtual entails a marriage of means and ends.\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>The virtual loathes representation or commercialization, half-baked metaphors or morality tales: because it is prefigurative and intensive in nature, it stands only for itself. Any teenager can tell the difference between the cultural products of focus groups (or the tv series scripts of grad students) and the eccentric or disturbed creativity of those who bothered to turn off the faucet of means and ends; who ventured to listen to the “penumbra” silence of the material world in ordert to create an honest and self-contained impersonal expression that  “cannot be determinately indexed to anything outside of itself.” Outside of the instrumentalizing imperatives of institutions, the actual that is produced can be grounded in the savage and pluralistic vectors of the plane of nature. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Take the nineteenth century critic John Ruskin’s description of the gothic builders, who he argues must have been “altogether set free” given their rude and obstinate creations, “creations of ungainly shape and rigid limb, but full of wolfish life.” [4] He saw in their disturbed, gargoyle eccentricity “a profound sympathy with the fulness and wealth of the material universe.” Their imagination appears conjured from the stone, a materialist imagination, gained not by imposition but by a transpersonal ordeal and a negotiation with the material conditions before them. We see it in the psychedelic and nonsymbolic color-codes of Edgar Allen Poe’s “Masque of the Red Death,” the barely melodic screams of Diamanda Galas, Sun Ra’s space outfits, Robert Chamber’s Yellow King: raw visceral expression that is anything but metaphor, a record of a material encounter beyond objects.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"the-virtual-is-available-to-strategy-and-formalization-even-as-it-remains-resistant-to-standardization\">The virtual is available to strategy and formalization even as it remains resistant to standardization.\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>As we have seen in the “two squeezes method” of Jay Wiseman’s s/m manual outlined in the \u003Ca href=\"https://www.openmutualism.xyz/Open-Protocol-Research-Group/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground\">previous essay\u003C/a>, undergrounds have been known to generate detailed strategies for attaining access to the virtual. To say that mechanization or instrumentalization by standardized regimes results in harsh diminishment of the virtual is not to say that some manner of repeated protocolization isn’t needed. The protocol underground is nothing but these intergenerational and cultural strategies for engaging the intensive. (As we will see later, these \u003Cem>open protocols\u003C/em> differ from institutional ones insomuch as, rather than dealing with objects and atoms, they are oriented toward a field or phase space, a polyvocal order-of-things full of divergence and indeterminacy.) \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The virtual, in brief, is a real and powerful dimension of the material world, but it appears phantom to many because it does not correlate with naked subjects. To relate to it and be empowered by it depends on a porousness in one’s individuality, an unthought, known as much to craftsmen and athletes as to religious mystics and artists. In the realm of institutions, whether nationalist, commercial, religious, we see its power captured and chained to brands, figureheads, flags, sentimental imaginals far removed from the eccentricity and in-itselfness of the plane of nature. It is beholden to a \u003Cem>telos\u003C/em>, always something or someone else’s end: mystified, antireal, rooted in domination. The underground, in the accumulated, impersonal intentionality of its designs, asserts the autonomy, ubiquity, and democracy of the virtual.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>An underground value-accounting of the virtual as a ninth form of capital would need to somehow follow this prefigurative circle. It would seek to expand rather than reduce and control. As we have learned from the underground, this means asserting a savage and uncaptured pacifism, defiance of the tendency of violence (especially hidden or implied, Graeber’s ‘structural violence’) to drain the atmosphere, divorce means from ends and fill the room with anti-aura of rigid persons and things. Take us literally when we say that the objects in a space withdrawal their power when supremacy is in the room. “Anything will give up its secrets if you love it enough” [5] - the inverse is true. The underground long since moved this knowledge from poetic insight to actionable process. The decentralized web can iterate into this mode, join forces, become underground. But, in the tradition of design pragmatism - the rational inspiration that informed the eight forms framework in Gregory Landua and Ethan Roland’s \u003Cem>\u003Cstrong>Regenerative Enterprise\u003C/strong>\u003C/em> - it must do so in unsuperstitious aspect.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The prefigurative virtual: its stakes are no less real for being “vague”. [6] Establish peace, find an impersonal attention, die a little, and watch the room awaken around you. Deep roots sprouting. This is intersubjective power. How to formalize it?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"open-protocols--peaceful-money\">Open Protocols &#x26; Peaceful Money\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The Open Protocol Research Group and Ethereal Forest have, across our work and investigations, hinted at a generalized autonomism (independence from structures of legitimate violence) and toward legitimacy by other means. In the case of crypto, this takes the form of thermodynamically or mathematically secured cryptographic “hardness.” [7] In the analogue realm, communities of intersubjective trust (what Austin Wade Smith once called “epi-consent”) fill this same role. It is the underground thesis of web3 adoption that the two could be weaved together by the protocolized structures of decentralized and emergent legitimacy - strategies that both have discovered, as a matter of prefigurative necessity. Open protocolization is the structural bridge, peaceful autonomy is the deep value that buttresses it. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>What becomes clear from the investigation into the underground, the realm of open protocols, is that it is the very process of relating to the virtual that makes the open protocol thesis work. Recall the definition: open protocols are “social and technical protocols woven together into a compound cultural protocol of improvisational, empirical imagination.” This “atmosphere” of divergence and open empiricism, the enthusiasm for the intersubjective field, is what lends open protocols the viral memetic power to circulate in the underground. They are programmed with its real effects. If, as Massumi writes, “the surplus of reality that constitutes the virtual guarantees the gift of freedom granted to the actual,” open protocols are empowered by the freedom of actualization. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And yet, there remains this final boss of institutionalization, virally decentralized and free floating, that aspires to enter into every relationship and divorce means and ends. “Money designates and reproduces a specific social structure,” write Hardt &#x26; Negri. “Money \u003Cem>institutionalizes\u003C/em> a social relation—or, rather, a set of relations of social production and reproduction.” The underground finds itself in a double bind inasmuch as the resources needed for social relations to reproduce themselves are tethered to a mechanism for divorcing means and ends. The capacities of money - the unit of account, the means of exchange, the store of value - are not institutional in and of themselves, but their particular configuration in the arbitrary and violently conditioned order of \u003Cem>fiat\u003C/em>. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>In no way is this group endorsing the abolition of money, even in its current form; fiat, or something that looks like it, will continue to have important use cases, especially as an “exit value” from the geographical and contextual locales invoked below. In the outside and interstitial spaces of these locales, there is room for a non-institutional form of it. But as as long as the whole index of value forms is systematically subjugated to the rule of financial capital - as long as the circulation of resources is directed toward the supernaturalist myopia of profit-in-itself - autonomist relationships will be systematically diminished and marginalized. What is needed, if we are reading the landscape correctly, is an extitutional or underground account of capital that could think both autonomy and the virtual that autonomy affords access to. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Massumi himself, along with colleague Erin Manning, took a shot at an expression of extitutional capital in their collaborations with the Economic Space Agency. [8] We encourage any reader to explore the Three Ecologies Institute and the 3E Process Seed Bank. It’s our feeling that these efforts were partially compromised by the institutional conditions of their emergence. (Consider the title of this article on SenseLab, of which 3EI is an outgrowth: “Philosophy Can Be  a Living Process: Inside Senselab’s Radically Interdisciplinary Graduate Research Culture.”) We’ll let the graduate students enjoy their Temporary Autonomous Zones within the university walls. But the highest stake projects in the “revaluation of value” are not to be found, in our opinion, in the isolation of art projects funded by university endowment funds. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>To forge a new direction, we propose an encounter with the extant models of altereconomic creativity, circulating open protocols of the underground that orbit the virtual as both the memetic fuel for their reproduction and the end goal of their operations. They work at a different level of extitutional clarity, being “located” in ephemeral pop up efforts, occasional excitations of what is properly a field of pluralistic and technological improvisation. Insomuch as the Open Protocol Research Group and our extitutional affiliates remain without institutional affiliation - inasmuch as DAOs are mere excitations of an ecosystem substrate with always porous boundaries and prefigurative ends - we may have the right eyes to develop practical concepts from this clarity. And potentially, given enough patience and receptivity, to weave those concepts into the field. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"undercapital\">undercapital\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>What’s ultimately at play in this research vector is the distinction between enumerating the virtual -  instrumentalizing it to the end of indexed quantity - and extracting or “expressing” from it operational passages that can expand or formalize prefiguration. We must, as we say, \u003Cem>formalize without standardizing\u003C/em>.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Undercapital\u003C/strong> is the combinatorial problem space - the sum of operational passages - of the eight forms of capital and the three faculties of money when deployed toward the expansion of the virtual field. This takes the form of a literal matrix of possible combinations of these forms, but it does so in a peculiar way: because the virtual field expands under prefigurative conditions, the submersion of the various forms into themselves, even individually, produces the virtual as a positive externality (just as a swordmaker, in the transpersonal process of gaining artful expertise in the craft, discovers an instance of the virtual animating his steels). When realist conditions are present - peace in the absence of institutional regimes, consent, fluency in intersubjective physics - the virtual is abundant. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>And if undercapital is oriented by the wealth of the virtual that accompanies it, we know which way the ship sails: This is the same wealth that give substance and reproductive capacity to open protocols, inasmuch as they diminish the need for institutions. Encoded in their strategies of open use and propagation is an assertion of the open field of (empirical) possibility as an end in itself. To this extent, the stakes of undercapital are entangled with a structural attitude of p2p and stigmeric coordination, and protocolization as a free formalization of any would be “standard.”\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Still, the question remains of value flow: if open protocols are the path forward, what kind of economic games could push toward a tipping of the scale in the direction of protocolization? If extitutions (defined in previous work as outposts of open protocols that feign institutional legibility but whose behavior is only understood in an open protocol framework) are needed to expand the reach of open protocols, how can they be integrated into systems of multicapital provisioning that avoid financialization?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Experimental efforts to multiply the forms of capital that people organize themselves around have an accomplished history that we can learn from. Every city has their local coups. For our town of Portland, one of the most significant coups is the decades-old initiative the Rebuilding Center.

Once recognized, those who possess them tend to be empowered and energized by the realization of their direct autonomous access to important stores of wealth, and step 1 is emboldened.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Develop a protocol of sustainable and effective resource allocation.\u003C/strong> This involves everything from community governance (esp. when the resource being allocated is based in living capital, i.e. cultural and social) to navigating the revenue evil curve.

(The second order effects are intersectional because the direct access to multicapital wealth cuts across multiple systems of exploitation.) Most important to the formula is the way in which the autonomous capacity of the initiative allows for an expansion of the Overton Window of what constitutes acceptable public action. [9]\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>This playbook (a common roadmap for the most extitutionally oriented nonprofits) constitutes a field-tested strategy for staving off the worst elements of standardization and scaling more or less on the community’s own terms and within patterns that light the way to autonomy from the instrumental reign of financial profit. Being a large, multiple city block-sized brick and mortar outfit, the rigorous correspondence to a range of regulatory and financial standards was an unavoidable need for RC. But it may be the case that undercapital initiatives can’t follow this path.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It seems uncontroversial to those familiar with underground communities that undergrounds simply do not scale. This insight is usually delivered with a superstitious air or a veteran’s cynicism: “nothing good in this world can last.” It’s important to internalize this field knowledge, but it is for us realists to reject any tendency to quietism and supernaturalism: as Massumi and Deleuze show us, the virtual is \u003Cem>real\u003C/em> if not actual. It’s expression is akin to the probabilistic fields of post-Newtonian physics: we can design around these real elements so long as we consider them not as particles, quantities, objects, but as the distributed likelihood of a visitation. And we know - or rather we can learn - what increases the likelihood.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Consider the three major elements of undergrounds identified in the previous essay: The mutual assumption of high agency. A robust culture of informed and affirmative consent. A participatory and pluralistic aesthetic. In a word, the charge of the virtual, the \u003Cem>stuff\u003C/em> of the underground, depends upon conditions of inter-agency, whereas the modes of consumption common to institutional spaces depend upon a learned passivity or complacency and a commercially or administratively driven taste for homogeneity. For scaling undergrounds, this makes for (at least) three specific barriers:\u003C/p>\n\u003Col>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Institutional-behavioral bias.\u003C/strong> In the United States, we have a complex and multilayered bureaucratic regime of licensed specialization, as well as a deeply cynical culture of litigious opportunism bolstered by a professional class of legal professionals. This puts consumers and owners in what Slate Star Codex famously called a “multipolar trap,” a downward spiral of paralysis before mutually interwoven elements that are, in their sum, oppressive.  Participatory patterns of high agency and active rather than consumptive aesthetic creation suffocate under standards optimized - or regulatorily disciplined into - a low agency logic.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Limits to circulation of underground protocols.\u003C/strong> Similarly, large scale operations attract low agency participants, and in particular participants who are not sophisticated enough in strategies of affirmative consent and negotiated intersubjectivity to be able to attend to the needs of the atmosphere. Underground activities require cultural or placed-based specificity, what Ven calls “the contextual/geographical local” i.e. a scene or a neighborhood - in order to meaningfully develop and sustain the characteristics of a high agency public. When it sees a scene scale beyond this local specificity, the virtual flees with both feet.\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003Cli>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cstrong>Cult of personality.\u003C/strong> Perhaps the most delicate feature of undergrounds, the one that breaks the most quickly when scaling, are their headlessness. The specter of a cult of personality is wonderfully destructive in two senses: the ability of outsiders to identify a literal or figurative locus of liability, a scapegoat, which it can “coopt, kill or imprison” (in the case of artistic movements, this is almost always cooptation or self-destruction); the tendency for elements in the community to elevate a locus of energy that they can \u003Cem>withdraw agency\u003C/em> to (in this way, the cult of personality reflects in one breath the worst tendencies of problem 1 &#x26; 2).\u003C/p>\n\u003C/li>\n\u003C/ol>\n\u003Cp>There’s a contradiction latent in the question of scaling communities of the virtual insomuch as the virtual is a facet of material contingency. Think of it as a moving image of potential manifestations produced by a given material to show, for the benefit of those who have bothered to encounter it, its singularity. For a shopping complex, an acre of land is an acre of land: the environments of communities of the virtual enjoy no such fungibility. In a passage of some of his earliest reflections on the virtual from Difference and Repetition (1968), Deleuze writes: \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>For the nature of the virtual is such that, for it, to be actualised is to be differenciated. Each differenciation is a local integration or a local solution which then connects with others in the overall solution or the global integration. This is how, in the case of the organic, the process of actualisation appears simultaneously as the local differenciation of parts, the global formation of an internal milieu, and the solution of a problem posed within the field of constitution of an organism. An organism is nothing if not the solution to a problem, as are each of its differenciated organs, such as the eye which solves a light ‘problem’; but nothing within the organism, no organ, would be differenciated without the internal milieu endowed with a general effectivity or integrating power of regulation.\u003C/em> \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Note that the organism is not a metaphor here: this divergent actualization occurs across scales, and is as true of organisms as well as geographies, languages, cultures. The nuance between actualization and the virtual itself is admittedly a difficult one, but we can note that organisms, languages, geographies, enrich and intensify the field of real possibles: the stakes, then, of the need for the local to “connect with others” is the persistence and expansion of the material trace which creates more intensity, more dense potential. They become an organism so they can persist in difference. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Already in “\u003Ca href=\"https://www.openmutualism.xyz/Open-Protocol-Research-Group/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground\">Sketches\u003C/a>” we’ve seen the illicit underground discover, out of necessity, a strategy of open protocolization resistant to the three barriers to scaling. To preserve underground values and subvert the key mechanistic depressions of the virtual field, they scaled horizontally in a way that was culturally and technically headless. But their rebuttal to the supernaturalists comes at a cost: with each instance of horizontal scaling comes a fracturing of coherence, a \u003Cem>difference\u003C/em>: to persist, they sacrifice a body, diffusing like a mist (or hardening into cooptations, \u003Cem>giving up the ghost\u003C/em> as it were). \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The strategic problem space of undercapital, of the formalizable potential systems of an overground society of the virtual, is how to take advantage of this drift, how to alchemize it from “local” degradation to global enrichment: a “\u003Cem>general effectivity\u003C/em>” or integrating power. In the case of Deleuze’s body, “\u003Cem>no organ would be differenciated without the internal milieu endowed with a general effectivity\u003C/em>.” Are the disparate cells capable of operation totally separate from the milieu? Only insofar as they can survive without resources (not very far). They’re viable difference is contingent on their relation to the unity of the body. If undergrounds die - or if we often offer experience undergrounds in their fleetingness, in a persistent dying - it would seem to be because they lack a concept of \u003Cem>general effectivity\u003C/em>, a notion of commonness with the autonomous and horizontally scaling “differenciations”. So what would be the contours of this “general effectivity,” this body?\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-note-on-the-category-of-art\">A note on the category of art\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>So far much of our reflection on the underground has been reduced to the so-called “arts” It strikes us that the label “art” is a strategy for compartmentalizing and mollifying what should rightfully be a primary tension in our society, even greater than that of class. A common refrain, “She makes it into an \u003Cem>art form\u003C/em>,” would seem to signal both deference and mild condescension: she goes too far, aestheticizes it too much, \u003Cem>she’s an accountant for Christ’s sake\u003C/em>. This signals to us that many fields are pregnant with the stilted excess of deep material engagement. Beyond logistical comprehension is material knowledge, and deep material knowledge is (again) an intersubjective and ontologically challenging ordeal. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If the arts provide countless examples of rhizomatic free association indexed against dynamic and locally contingent material and technical conditions, they are only a prefiguration of a material inspiration that might consume all sectors. \u003Cem>Art is a fallacy, we all must become artists.\u003C/em> Or rather, the underground is ubiquitous inasmuch as many of us are all already artists, engaging with local virtuals, seeing through (or more accurately, seeing \u003Cem>with\u003C/em>) the garden or the refurbished bookshelf, whatever we have cared to deeply know in its own expression, to the multiplicity it contains.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"actualizing-undercapital\">Actualizing Undercapital\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>The question of undercapital, the mobilization of the eight forms of capital and the three faculties of money to the expansion of the virtual field, is also the question of constructing a body from these pluralistic and multiscale social forms through which nutritive resources can be circulated: what Spinoza calls “a common notion.” \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>One could argue that the virtual, by virtue of its immeasurability, is anathema to design, planning or global conceptualization. It seems to be the general opinion of the zeitgeist, for the moment. As materialists, we can’t help call this out as fallacy: we are merely entering the era where relational fields must be privileged over objects/particles, where a new type of planning needs to be conceptualized in reference to a probabilistic rather than quantitative index. Fields are real, they are just of a different order of causality. Undercapital asks: \u003Cem>How can we develop economic games that relate to intersubjective fields?\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>For a first target, the low-hanging fruit is open protocolization itself. Undercapital enthusiasts can fund pop-up think tanks that work to solve, in a given context (any given context, at any scale), problems like the following:\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"how-can-a-protocol-be-employed-to-intensive-ends\">How can a protocol be employed to intensive ends?\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>Consider the work done to adapt LSD from a DoD mind control initiative to a tool for exploring the intersubjective field (“Turn on, Tune in, Drop out”). We have discussed at length how certain technologies of reuse and repair or small scale food production have been honed in the direction of autonomy from centralized systems. What manner of creative divergence comes from those who go to their garden rather than the CVS, who depend on their knowledge in a craft over their appetite for consumerism to fix a problem of sustenance? \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Like the free parties discussed in the first post, in some cases the journey might be greater than the destination. The labor intensive nature of autonomous action generates the positive externality of deep material engagement, just as deep material engagement often generates the positive externality of autonomy. Other practices at the level of the individual and below might be encoded that could add further positive externalities, ones which the individuals themselves could benefit form. The virtual takes care of its own. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"how-can-protocols-stack-to-maximize-each-others-capacities\">How can protocols stack to maximize each other’s capacities?  \u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>The multiscale character of the virtual is a rich design vector: open protocols for seeding ubiquitous local gardens, results themselves of a caring transpersonal ordeal, could scale the viability of autonomous pharmaceutical experiments that lead to new horizons of non-normal states. A renaissance of garage manufacturing and hardware hacking could develop into regional or even neighborhood aesthetic vernaculars, communities erupting in swells of participatory agency over their environment. As in the case of the multi-capital initiatives mentioned earlier, formalized strategies for encountering the virtual generate second order effects that diminish institutions and encourage material curiosity, open empiricism, intersubjectvie games. The virtual is the subliminal means by which a general autonomism could go viral. \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch4 id=\"what-are-the-contours-of-minimal-viable-evasion\">What are the contours of Minimal Viable Evasion?\u003C/h4>\n\u003Cp>The regulatory authority of the state acts on always shifting ground, push and pull regimes of emphasis and favor. Undergrounds, especially urban undergrounds are well aware of the many areas where non-enforcement is a de facto policy. Despite stereotypes, it would appear to us that law enforcement in underfunded urban locales are often willing to ignore a peaceful good time so long as the participants have done due diligence with neighbors and other local stakeholders. The problem comes when large scale commercial or public interests are significantly threatened, especially when it comes to legal liability. Kyle Smith at LexDAO has invoked “inverted precedent,” potential legal engineering tactics for establishing autonomous contracts that would be recognized by the state. How can these be combined with known underground tactics for staying under the radar of enforcement to generate passable strategies for the kind of participatory and experimental gatherings needed for group encounters with the virtual?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ephemeral open protocol DAOs might pop up for six weeks or six months to accomplish deep research in the extant tactics and the new technological strategies available, contribute it to the strategic lexicon (an open protocol library like the one being established at Open Civics), and dissolve. Members of our community are already working on forking Protocol Guilds self-curated registries in order to establish vehicles for flowing resources to researchers who prioritize protocolization as a means of supporting and maintaining the extitutional clarity of the underground.\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"token-engineering\">Token Engineering\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Inasmuch as communities that are oriented toward the virtual field take the shape of this fragmented milieu, the clearest path for formalizing value flows in their direction is to establish network effects by way of an economic grammar for common cause. Can reputation tokens be deployed to solve scaling problem number two, the circulation of protocols and etiquette for high agency participation? Individuals could establish peer legitimacy in one scene and use it as entry to another - no need for one standard, they could be pluralistic - but in our view the dynamics of surveillance and implications of “social credit score” would do more harm to the prospect of intersubjective ordeals than it would benefit the scaling problem. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Community reputation tokens would invert the logic - they could be used to solicit resources, encouraging high agency participants to engage new scenes while leaving it to the scenes themselves to maintain a vertical limit to scaling (an important engine of horizontal differenciation) corresponding to the physics of underground etiquette or ‘epi-consent.’ These may, however, be contradictory inputs: generally, the key strategy for preserving epi-consent is to remain opaque to the general public. The design game amounts to a rivalrous balance between social capital and virtual capital, the hazards of public legibility to the maintenance of the vibe.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The desired path would seem to require a negotiation between the two: some level of minimum viable reputation token to allow trusted participants to signal that a locale meets a given rubric of the underground - most of all robust consent protocols and institutional disaffiliation - mixed with a zero knowledge architecture for dispersing funds to a burner address for a scene without requiring public visibility of that scene.  Guerilla funders could send fleets of high trust auditors into the global underground to jumpstart resource flows, signaling across months to generate a registry in which \u003Cem>something\u003C/em> cool is happening, who knows what?(This would require fairly elaborate legal engineering that we think are nonetheless viable.) A side effect of this scene-anonymous resource share is a collective underconsciousness of the underground, a knowledge that a tide is rising, and access to resources are no longer contingent on institutional legibility.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Still, these designs are trapped within a logic of \u003Cem>financial capital allocation\u003C/em> between \u003Cem>discrete entities\u003C/em>. Undercapital design gets much more savage when tracing multicapital and multifunctional allocation techniques across horizontally expanding threads of the underground, defined not in terms of discrete entities - not even primarily extitutions - but protocols and fields. When material labor becomes de-institutionalized, tinged with affect and virtual life, are its products scarce in the same way? Cultural, experiential and intellectual capital, the key substances of (socio-)technical open protocols, may have the power to render the other forms abundant in a way that deemphasizes traditional economic scarcity. What then?\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>It’s hard to say what is science fiction and what is a direct material path forward - that is the work of an undercapital analysis that could take years to unfold. Yet open protocolization and the viral adoption of virtually grounded autonomous labor could unfold into a runaway complementarity at any time. Our engineering efforts should occupy that gap. What can dynamic issuance, bonding curves, self-curated registries and on-chain mutual credit mean for a first breath of an inverted city or cultural economy? As supermodular network effects outside of institutions grow into a common wealth, is some economic activity supplanted by a highly engaged tokenized commons governance that mirrors the polycentric and ever-forking structure of the open protocols? \u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"a-memetic-frame-for-a-general-effectivity-of-the-virtual\">A memetic frame for a ‘general effectivity’ of the virtual\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>Many cultures have a festival of the liminal - All Hallows Eve, Fet Gede, Día de los muertos, Gaelic Samhain, Walpurgis Night, the Hungry Ghost festival, days where the boundary between earth and the underworld is thin. They are at once utterly populist, but charged with gothic indulgences - spectors of “inorganic life”, atmospheric disorientation, a sense of coextensive realities - auric joys within a kind of folk mysticism of the earth. The literary critic Mikhail Bakhtin writes of the carnivalesque aura commonly associated with the folk underworld, as opposed to the solemn and guilt-ridden portrayals of institutional regimes. We’ll quote him at length, from his \u003Cem>Problems of Dosteovsky’s Poetics\u003C/em>: what constitutes the carnivalesque? \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Carnival is a pageant without footlights and without a division into performers and spectators. In carnival everyone is an active participant, everyone communes in the carnival act. Carnival is not contemplated and, strictly speaking, not even performed; its participants live in it, they live by its laws as long as those laws are in effect; that is, they live a carnivalistic life. Because carnivalistic life is life drawn out of its usual rut, it is to some extent “life turned inside out,” “the reverse side of the world” (“monde al’envers”).\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>The laws, prohibitions, and restrictions that determine the structure and order of ordinary, that is noncarnival, life are suspended during carnival: what is suspended first of all is hierarchical structure and all the forms of terror, reverence, piety, and etiquette connected with it ….\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Carnival is the place for working out, in a concretely sensuous, half-real and half-play-acted form, a new mode of interrelationship between individuals, counterposed to the all-powerful socio-hierarchical relationships of noncarnival life. The behavior, gesture, and discourse of a person are freed from the authority of all hierarchical positions (social estate, rank, age, property) defining them totally in noncarnival life, and thus from the vantage point of noncarnival life become eccentric and inappropriate. Eccentricity is a special category of the carnival sense of the world, organically connected with the category of familiar contact; it permits - in concretely sensuous form - the latent sides of human nature to reveal and express themselves.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Linked with familiarization is a third category of the carnival sense of the world: carnivalistic mésalliances. A free and familiar attitude spreads over everything: over all values, thoughts, phenomena, and things. All things that were once self-enclosed, disunified, distanced from one another by a noncarnivalistic hierarchical worldview are drawn into carnivalistic contacts and combinations. Carnival brings together, unifies, weds, and combines the sacred with the profane, the lofty with the low, the great with the insignificant, the wise with the stupid.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Connected with this is yet a fourth carnivalistic category, profanation: carnivalistic blasphemies, a whole system of carnivalistic debasings and bringings down to earth, carnivalistic obscenities linked with the reproductive power of the earth and the body, carnivalistic parodies on sacred texts and sayings, etc.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Later:\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cem>Carnival is past millennia’s way of sensing the world as one great communal performance. This sense of the world, liberating one from fear, bringing the world maximally close to a person and bringing one person maximally close to another (everything is drawn into the zone of free familiar contact), with its joy at change and its joyful relativity, is opposed to that one-sided and gloomy official seriousness which is dogmatic and hostile to evolution and change, which seeks to absolutize a given condition of existence or a given social order.\u003C/em>\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As we have seen, our undergrounds have far advanced from the folk wisdom of the crowd, adopting a design consciousness proper not to a common tourist but a seasoned traveller - and yet the germ of a cultural knowledge of the power of the virtual and the implications of contacting it is here in these age old features of the carnivalesque. They are a deep psychic heritage. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Crypto has always carried with it a strange inversion, even paranoia: the integrity and immutability of the blockchain calls into question the integrity of all else, making the world a cauldron of potential relativity, propaganda, statecraft. The culture at large is at an extreme saturation of distrust for institutions, making for a living global carnival of AI infections, UFOs, snake oil salesmen of all types: the unipolar integrity of the post-Cold War period has fragmented into a million pieces. To the perspectival disorientation of the carnivalesque, the populous is well-initiated. Now they need to find orientation in that new cosmology.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>We have long considered solidity devs, musicians, party alchemists, woodworkers, guerilla chemists, etc. to be kindred spirits in their dedication to “the craft.” The layer of psychonautic inquiry added to all of these material enterprises when one considers the \u003Cem>virtual field\u003C/em> that flanks them gives the term “craft” a different sense entirely. A concept of the wisdom of astrology, tarot and witchcraft has passed over into the mainstream and is on the tip of everyone’s tongue.The folk underworld revival in our culture - significant since at least the seventies, but resurgent in the post-covid era - points to a desire for agency in the virtual field.

First among these were “open protocols.” \n\nOpen protocols have two key features: **memeticism** and **open-ended empiricism**. These sociotechnical knowledge sets circulate through the social, crystallizaing before diverse publics and environments into maximally versatile & practical forms. They are finely tuned, concretized cognitive assets. The genius of the publics.\n\nInstitutional protocols, on the other hand, tend to the inverse, becoming *anti-memetic* (discouraging reproduction: think military classification, NDAs, industrial secrets) and *anti-empirical* (resistant to inconvenient truths, interpretations or revisions that may have empirical veracity but be contrary to the interests of an organization or its authorities).\n\nAs part of their open crystallization, then, it’s necessary that open protocols take on an anti-institutional character; to persist in their form, they have to discourage closed values like centralization, totalization, enclosure, branding, elite capture, etc.\n\n--- \n\nIn their work on Extitutional Theory, Jessy Kate Schingler and Primavera de Filippi\nhave argued that all social processes contain “an interplay between institutional and extitutional dynamics” - extitutional referring here to implicit and emergent patterns rather than explicit, standardized ones. Jumping off of that distinction last year, OPRG [proposed the existence](https://www.openmutualism.xyz/exeunt/Sketches-Toward-a-Theory-of-the-Protocol-Underground) of ***protocol undergrounds***: loose, informal communities tethered together only by open protocols. These are wide spanning areas of creative social practice where extitutional dynamics are *dominant*, and institutional dynamics are actively avoided. \n\n**Extitutions**, we argued, could refer to the small, often ephemeral organizational bodies that use the benefits of institutional legibility to secure, protect and formalize the open empiricism of protocol undergrounds. The name was chosen to emphasize that they are discrete, atomic counterparts to the field-like and process forward phenomena of extitutional dynamics.\n\nExtitutions here generally serve two roles:\n\na) bundling technical protocols with open cultural values to shield them from capture, \n\nb) erecting or facilitating temporary autonomous zones to aid the crystallization of those values.\n\nThey can be thought of as institutional avatars of protocol undergrounds, strategically deployed to fill power vacuums and keep institutional capture at bay. This often means taking on a trickster character, making deliberately disingenuous and playful use of institutional structures, running *distract* while the extitutional networks they serve remain in a state of illegibility. \n\nIn the 1980’s/ 90’s, a noted strategy of the indie music scene was the creation of pop up labels. Meant to exist only for a short period, these pseudo-institutions would serve the purpose of limited liability and economic coordination for 3-6 months, then would Ben deliberately run into the ground and popped up in alternate form. Their goal was never the success of the label, but the success - i,e, the resistance from corporate or commercial capture - of the scene. Moreover, the scene itself was defined only by its shared cultural and technical strategies of free, experimental expression - its open protocols).\n\nThroughout the seventies, the Orange County collective [The Brotherhood of Eternal Love](https://web.archive.org/web/20150623155828/http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-07-07/features/lords-of-acid/) formalized the cheap and exploitation-free distribution of LSD, filling a vacuum that otherwise would have been occupied by capture-oriented organized crime or cartels. They also worked to imbue the culture with a spiritual anarchsm that resisted gurus or easy ideology, relying on humor and irreverence to keep truth a floating target.

Minds, according to no**ö**punks, are distributed across organisms, ecosystems, dynamic material processes, socio-technical networks; they are innate in nature, latent in living and nonliving systems and activated wherever sensemaking processes discover loops of self-regulation. In that carnival of diverse intelligence, no**ö**punk experimentalists search out new connections, new assemblages, new edges of mutual coherence, discovering as well as constructing minds. For a century this has taken many forms: sound art, cinematic or literary explorations, various underground approaches to cognitive ethnography, biohacking or biosemiotics; here I argue that, in order to consequentialize those journeys, bring them fully into our shared epistemology, we must elevate them to the realm of economic exchange: a no**ö**punk economic life of the many minds. [1]\n\nThe no**ö**punk movement has many births. One of them is Edward Hutchins 1995 paper “[How a Cockpit remembers its speeds](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS102B/Hutchins95.pdf).” In it, Hutchins argues for the existence of cognitive systems in exotic substrates: “the classical cognitive science approach can be applied with little modification to a unit of analysis that is larger than an individual person. One can still ask the same questions of a larger socio-technical system that one would ask of the individual.” Such socio-technical systems, Hutchins argued, “may have cognitive properties in their own right that cannot be reduced to the cognitive properties of individual persons” The approach, known as distributed cognition, or cognitive ecology**,** cracks open the humanist paradigm to reveal a host of social agencies in the panorama - no mere metaphors, but distinct creatures. [2]\n\nAs [Arthur Koestler would say](http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/10/099.html), we are all holons in the interparticipatory social cognitive fabric. And, as Lynn Margulis conveyed to the public in her work with Dorion Sagan, we emerge from the milieu of cognitive creatures that make the human body a symbiotic superorganism, a temporary treatise of heterogenous minds with different prerogatives. As we ride the scales, Hutchins’ cockpit becomes more and more crowded: James Shapiro announces that “[All Living Cells are Cognitive](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32972747/)”; Michael Levin studies the diverse capacities of [basal cognitions](https://link.springer.com/collections/aacdfgjegj) in lab settings, finding “[surprising competencies](https://osf.io/preprints/psyarxiv/5g2xj_v1)” that hint at even more exotic forms, agential, disembodied minds in a non-physical, “latent” space. (The cockpit is haunted, too.)\n\nAside from these empirical and peer-reviewed blasphemies of the cogito, two pairs of thinkers stand out as founding figures of the no**ö**punk sensibility: the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze & Felix Guattari, and the Chilean biologists Francisco Varela and Humberto Maturana.\n\n![](https://www.artforum.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/article_large-3.jpg)\n\nHaving already rose to notoriety from a series of monographs on figures in the history of philosophy, Deleuze was challenged by the events of May ‘68 and his meeting with the antipsychiatrist and psychedelic user Felix Guattari to make his writing more dialogical, more intersubjective, more anonymous. Introducing their second collaboration, *A Thousand Plateaus*, they write:\n\n> The two of us wrote Anti-Oedipus together. Since each of us was several, there was already quite a crowd. … Why have we kept our own names? Out of habit, purely out of habit. To make ourselves unrecognizable in turn. To render imperceptible, not ourselves, but what makes us act, feel, and think. Also because it's nice to talk like everybody else, to say the sun rises, when everybody knows it's only a manner of speaking. To reach, not the point where one no longer says I, but the point where it is no longer of any importance whether one says I. We are no longer ourselves. Each will know his own. We have been aided, inspired, multiplied.\n\nThe two-volume *Capitalism and Schizophrenia* series identifies “machinic assemblages,” potent with desire, organized into complex, entangled embodiments, capable of nondual states and experiences of “pure immanence” that cut across and reconfigure the plane of organization spontaneously. Responding to Vladimir Vernadsky’s (decidedly unpunk) *noösphere*, they posit a “mechanosphere,” dynamic atmospheric schema not of a single rationality but of the many rationalities in their convergence (not at telos, but at base - swimming in the soup of difference and process).\n\n(One way to think about no**ö**punk is this subversion of and resistance to the totalizing pretentions of the noösphere, mutating the Omega Point from a rational apocalypse into the explosive initiation of an infinite game, a potent and creative disunity. As punk aesthetics have always known, the One is not some future event, but our founding condition in difference.)\n\nIn *Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living* (published the same year as *A Thousand Plateaus*), Varela and Maturana gave us a versatile enough definition of life-as-cognition to cover the whole stack, all the assemblages: cognitive systems, they argue, are autonomous, structurally coupled with their environment, and sense-making. With this empirical standard, we could now ask ourselves -  without regard for traditional substrates like brains - can we identify a Markov Blanket to delimit this system? does it have some mechanism for memory and internal coherence? Does it respond to its environment, does it process signals from the environment in one or a variety of operational hierarchies? [3]\n\nVarela went on to establish the field of “neuro-phenomenology,” a methodology for coupling exotic phenomenological states and subjective self-report with neurobiological data feeds to produce new models of (human) mind. Guattari later argues in *Chaosmosis* that Varela’s cognition is not open ended enough, that intelligence may be a latent characteristic of material dynamics that produces autopoetic closure and subjectivity. [4] One can imagine xenocognitive phenomenological projects of collective or atmospheric cognition, where the experimentalist produces - by way of LLMs or signal bundling - protosubjective read-write heads that grow in representational cognizance even as they are modeled.\n\nSuch exotic flights shouldn’t obscure the foundations of no**ö**punk - *radical empathy* and enthusiasm for the many forms that life, broadly considered, can take. First and foremost is curiosity about the interior lives, preferences and cognitive potential of animals - [Donald Griffin contra Thomas Nagel](https://archive.org/details/animalminds0000grif/page/n9/mode/2up) is great no**ö**punk lore - and outrage for the systems that try to instrumentalize them into mere objects for consumption. When creatures are seen not just as thinking and feeling, but embedded in larger cognitive systems, their behavior becomes an open question, the plasticity of their minds foregrounded. What cognitive assemblages could be built that would socially activate and amplify the neuroplastic potential of animals? Once done, where else can we take it? Fuck the descriptivist taxonomies of the institutions - a no**ö**punk empiricism is participatory, its portrait of nature a germinal vex, and it sees in all its displays of cognition arrows into the future.\n\n---\n\nThe investigation of cognition - empirical always, sometimes scientific/instrumental, sometimes [Goethian](https://www.natureinstitute.org/whole-organism-biology), sometimes psychedelic, artistic, ecstatic, empathic, [weird](https://algernonblackwood.org/Z-files/Willows.pdf) - is the aesthetic source and spiritual center of no**ö**punk. It need not be - and rarely is - directly endorsed by any academic tradition. Its cutting edge is a practical and open-ended empiricism, the surprise and delight at the utter contingency of what minds can do.\n\nInformation from no**ö**punk experiments is often pre-representational, aural or spectral, tactile in difficult to pin down ways (resonance, vibe, field). The music world has always been advanced - field recordings from Bernie Kraus, Hildegard Westerkamp, the curious cybernetics of Pierre Schaeffer’s *musique concrète*, Michael Prime; today Jana Winderen and Holly Herndon, play resonance games with minds and selves across the nature/culture binary. Sound art has a natural cognizance of the nested and intertwined harmonies of nonhuman agents. Grateful Dead, Funkadelic, Sun Ra were all great ambassadors of alien socio-bio-technical noise parliaments.  Underground experimentalists like [MycoLyco](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmw-u-2kzPQPO5n9sTpcyA) express a no**ö**punk archetype; even the cringey commercialization of MidiSprout is a part of the family.\n\nOn the more representational end stand the prolix confrontations of the modernists as they attempted to explode the ego into its diverse inputs and memberships: Finnegan’s Wake, Beckett’s The Unnamable, Woolf’s The Waves, the cybernetic stream of conscious of John Clare’s letters and journal entries. But “Literature” is a humanist’s game; when it comes to the weirdness and anarchic cognition-apophenia needed for no**ö**punk, genre fiction will always do it better: Algernon Blackwood, Lovecraft of course, Stanislaw Lem, Philip K. Dick, Frank Herbert, Octavia Butler’s Xenogenesis trilogy, Jeff VanderMeer, Laird Barron. Thomas Pynchon’s talking dogs, his adenoid.\n\n![](https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/230727142557-05-remedios-varo-artist-untold-art-history-sympathy.jpg?q=w_1160,c_fill/f_webp)\n\nRemedios Varo may be the beginning of a no**ö**punk visual grammar: carnivalesque, inhuman folklore, filled with odd interspecies systems, fantastic portraits of cognitive mésalliance. Paul Klee and Austin Osman Spare lived in worlds that were suspiciously tenanted, as did Takashi Murakami, if in a more ecstatic register. Basquiat tried to crack the code on social cognitive assemblages in order to transcend them; Hannah Weiner [played with collective enunciation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DF0IoXUGkKU&t=26s) as a prosthetic to temper her schizophrenia. Cinema, too, is a great carnival of speculative cognitive configuration: anything by Terry Gilliam; Charlie Kaufmann and Spike Jonez. *Upstream Color* is absolute canon. *Annihilation*. Tarkovsky, Cronenberg. Andrea Arnold’s *Cow*.\n\n![](https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f1/599/e8f5fb5bea18c25489663d399f3beff380-cow--.2x.rhorizontal.w700.jpg)\n\n---\n\nFor as long as I’ve been around, Solarpunk and Lunarpunk have been operative design aesthetics in web3 and dWeb, north stars responsible for catalyzing considerable gains for infrastructure for a new civilization. From a cultural atmosphere, they discovered a blend of technological optimism and defense that broke from the corporate narratives and pointed to new lands. It’s in this same spirit that I present no**ö**punk - a design horizon where biosemiotics, cognitive ecology and diverse intelligence fuse with the data sovereignty and permissionless (read: ontologically agnostic) p2p coordination enabled by dWeb, and the [value pluralism](https://pluranimity.org/2022/09/26/towards-heterotopia/) and emergent economic coherences allowed by cryptoeconomics.\n\nThe latter is especially high stakes. Many of us participate in worlds of many minds: we direct empathic labor and imagination at forests, rivers, the animals in our lives, the friendships and atmospheres, the collective psyches and material flowstates that make life worth living. Yet our core social infrastructures systematically subjugate them, even enact violence on them, in the interests of a mystified and unreal naked human subject supposed to persist without relations. Our technological imaginaries are captured by a chauvinism of the human mind, missions to mars and apocalyptic visions of AI as a superhuman clone, birthed *ex nihilo* with no regard for the complex parliament of things that will constitute it. No**ö**punk vibes dominate the underground, but they have no hold on the mass consequentialism of industry and mainstream politics, because they have been exiled by the main channels of social reproduction.\n\nIf this is so, it is because the economy is, after all, our primary shared epistemological substrate: our primary way of interpreting what has agency, what is intelligent, what is grievable, what is *real*. And our economy depends on privation, the generative contradictions of a quantified private individual who cannot be private, a process of intersubjective social production that must be captured by individuals. The tension and grieving of this awful, empirically absurd monolith after all produces more demand. Those that seek to fully consequentialize the inhuman and upgrade our collective *umwelt* to the cognitive ecology that science has unveiled for us must do so in economic space.\n\nNonhuman minds will continue to be marginalized until they can participate, stake their claim in the social fabric, escalate to the status of quantitative *mattering*. And yet, this mass of minds is fundamentally unaccountable: no ledger could totalize its nested and multiscale multiplicity; no objective index could recognize the speculative cognitive phenomena whose very existence may be contingent upon recognition. The no**ö**punk monies of the earth-with-many-minds must be *intersubjective* and *contextual*, creative accounts of value in a field that both allows for and plausibly merges those accounts.\n\nEthereum’s distributed ledger will provide the infrastructure for this exploratory multiplicity, but the apps need to be built. They will be speculative, aesthetically charged; they will be science fiction realized, metaphysical discourse operationalized to results beyond all expectation; they will be harrowing acts of empathic technology, calm technology, optimistic and heterogenous accounts of right relations. A no**ö**punk revolution that realizes money as a democratic social technology at the same time as it embeds it in the panoply: no more cognitive privation, your surroundings suspiciously tenanted, and a new economy that runs off of the abundance, rather than the scarcity, of mind.\n\nAs sure as history only encloses in order later to produce greater openings, the no**ö**punk economic revolution is a technological and empirical inevitability. The possibility space beckons, and the tools are available. However, the question remains, how to cross the umwelt gap between us and the many minds, dispel ourselves of [representational or rights based models](https://www.demnext.org/projects/paper-more-than-human-governance) of nonhuman agency that depend on centralized bodies, and give diverse intelligences means of direct participation in an economy that is semantically inclusive and multiple enough to engage them. Personally, I think this would require, on the one hand, a mass, decentralized experiment in biodata intermediation (along with other sensor technologies adequate to sociotechnical or collective minds) to the end of establishing direct feeds of intent or desire, and on the other, intent centric interfaces to radically diverse token economies that might contain those obscure intents. [5]\n\nBut this is a question with many answers. The face of no**ö**punk should be an open ended, decentralized, pluralistic, community-level empiricism, backyard gardens rigged up with Raspberry Pi’s and and homebrew biosensors, open source LLMs parsing cybernetic loops for a voice from the underground, ready to be made real.\n\n\n### Notes\n\n[1] My equation of cognitive capacity with “mind” here follows the biologist Michael Levin’s use, defended in his “Technological Approach to Mind Everywhere” framework.\n\n[2] “When I began, I was thinking in terms of the naturally situated cognition of individuals. It was only after I completed my first study period at sea that I realized the importance of the fact that cognition was socially distributed.” Hutchins in Cognition in the Wild (1995).\n\n[3] More speculatively: Does that sensemaking process bleed out of evolutionary fitness into excessive or “junk” deployments, writing Othello and Bitches’ Brew and Pulp Fiction, unspooling vermiculate patterns in biological forms, contemplating other wilder forms that “we do not know”? As I canoe down the Willamette and behold the facade of Forest Park, I have to ask, regarding the great expressive facade - what are the trees thinking?\n\n[4] The position is explained well in Weinbaum and Veitas’ Open-Ended Intelligence paper: “Actual sense-making is a continuous process of integration and disintegration of discrete individuals taking place in a network of agents and their interactions. In the context of cognition, sense-making is synonymous with individuation. It is important to note that in our general approach to cognition there is no a priori subject who ‘makes sense’. Both subjects and objects, agents and their environments co-emerge in the course of sense-making.”\n\n[5] I’ve been quietly developing and circulating research for my Signal Ecologies project along these lines; it will likely be the topic of my next piece.","src/content/essays/noopunk.md","b369c5f083721c7c",{"html":471,"metadata":472},"\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Gw0MdL1aAAATaV8?format=jpg&#x26;name=large\" alt=\"\">\u003C/p>\n\u003Ch2 id=\"noöpunk-toward-economic-experiments-with-the-carnival-of-minds\">No\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk: Toward Economic Experiments with the Carnival of Minds\u003C/h2>\n\u003Cp>No\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk is an aesthetic movement that sees the universe as a landscape of nested and entangled cognitive assemblages, or minds.

With this empirical standard, we could now ask ourselves -  without regard for traditional substrates like brains - can we identify a Markov Blanket to delimit this system? does it have some mechanism for memory and internal coherence? Does it respond to its environment, does it process signals from the environment in one or a variety of operational hierarchies? [3]\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Varela went on to establish the field of “neuro-phenomenology,” a methodology for coupling exotic phenomenological states and subjective self-report with neurobiological data feeds to produce new models of (human) mind. Guattari later argues in \u003Cem>Chaosmosis\u003C/em> that Varela’s cognition is not open ended enough, that intelligence may be a latent characteristic of material dynamics that produces autopoetic closure and subjectivity. [4] One can imagine xenocognitive phenomenological projects of collective or atmospheric cognition, where the experimentalist produces - by way of LLMs or signal bundling - protosubjective read-write heads that grow in representational cognizance even as they are modeled.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Such exotic flights shouldn’t obscure the foundations of no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk - \u003Cem>radical empathy\u003C/em> and enthusiasm for the many forms that life, broadly considered, can take. First and foremost is curiosity about the interior lives, preferences and cognitive potential of animals - \u003Ca href=\"https://archive.org/details/animalminds0000grif/page/n9/mode/2up\">Donald Griffin contra Thomas Nagel\u003C/a> is great no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk lore - and outrage for the systems that try to instrumentalize them into mere objects for consumption. When creatures are seen not just as thinking and feeling, but embedded in larger cognitive systems, their behavior becomes an open question, the plasticity of their minds foregrounded. What cognitive assemblages could be built that would socially activate and amplify the neuroplastic potential of animals? Once done, where else can we take it? Fuck the descriptivist taxonomies of the institutions - a no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk empiricism is participatory, its portrait of nature a germinal vex, and it sees in all its displays of cognition arrows into the future.\u003C/p>\n\u003Chr>\n\u003Cp>The investigation of cognition - empirical always, sometimes scientific/instrumental, sometimes \u003Ca href=\"https://www.natureinstitute.org/whole-organism-biology\">Goethian\u003C/a>, sometimes psychedelic, artistic, ecstatic, empathic, \u003Ca href=\"https://algernonblackwood.org/Z-files/Willows.pdf\">weird\u003C/a> - is the aesthetic source and spiritual center of no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk. It need not be - and rarely is - directly endorsed by any academic tradition. Its cutting edge is a practical and open-ended empiricism, the surprise and delight at the utter contingency of what minds can do.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Information from no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk experiments is often pre-representational, aural or spectral, tactile in difficult to pin down ways (resonance, vibe, field). The music world has always been advanced - field recordings from Bernie Kraus, Hildegard Westerkamp, the curious cybernetics of Pierre Schaeffer’s \u003Cem>musique concrète\u003C/em>, Michael Prime; today Jana Winderen and Holly Herndon, play resonance games with minds and selves across the nature/culture binary. Sound art has a natural cognizance of the nested and intertwined harmonies of nonhuman agents. Grateful Dead, Funkadelic, Sun Ra were all great ambassadors of alien socio-bio-technical noise parliaments.  Underground experimentalists like \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsmw-u-2kzPQPO5n9sTpcyA\">MycoLyco\u003C/a> express a no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk archetype; even the cringey commercialization of MidiSprout is a part of the family.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>On the more representational end stand the prolix confrontations of the modernists as they attempted to explode the ego into its diverse inputs and memberships: Finnegan’s Wake, Beckett’s The Unnamable, Woolf’s The Waves, the cybernetic stream of conscious of John Clare’s letters and journal entries. But “Literature” is a humanist’s game; when it comes to the weirdness and anarchic cognition-apophenia needed for no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk, genre fiction will always do it better: Algernon Blackwood, Lovecraft of course, Stanislaw Lem, Philip K.

From a cultural atmosphere, they discovered a blend of technological optimism and defense that broke from the corporate narratives and pointed to new lands. It’s in this same spirit that I present no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk - a design horizon where biosemiotics, cognitive ecology and diverse intelligence fuse with the data sovereignty and permissionless (read: ontologically agnostic) p2p coordination enabled by dWeb, and the \u003Ca href=\"https://pluranimity.org/2022/09/26/towards-heterotopia/\">value pluralism\u003C/a> and emergent economic coherences allowed by cryptoeconomics.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The latter is especially high stakes. Many of us participate in worlds of many minds: we direct empathic labor and imagination at forests, rivers, the animals in our lives, the friendships and atmospheres, the collective psyches and material flowstates that make life worth living. Yet our core social infrastructures systematically subjugate them, even enact violence on them, in the interests of a mystified and unreal naked human subject supposed to persist without relations. Our technological imaginaries are captured by a chauvinism of the human mind, missions to mars and apocalyptic visions of AI as a superhuman clone, birthed \u003Cem>ex nihilo\u003C/em> with no regard for the complex parliament of things that will constitute it. No\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk vibes dominate the underground, but they have no hold on the mass consequentialism of industry and mainstream politics, because they have been exiled by the main channels of social reproduction.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>If this is so, it is because the economy is, after all, our primary shared epistemological substrate: our primary way of interpreting what has agency, what is intelligent, what is grievable, what is \u003Cem>real\u003C/em>. And our economy depends on privation, the generative contradictions of a quantified private individual who cannot be private, a process of intersubjective social production that must be captured by individuals. The tension and grieving of this awful, empirically absurd monolith after all produces more demand. Those that seek to fully consequentialize the inhuman and upgrade our collective \u003Cem>umwelt\u003C/em> to the cognitive ecology that science has unveiled for us must do so in economic space.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Nonhuman minds will continue to be marginalized until they can participate, stake their claim in the social fabric, escalate to the status of quantitative \u003Cem>mattering\u003C/em>. And yet, this mass of minds is fundamentally unaccountable: no ledger could totalize its nested and multiscale multiplicity; no objective index could recognize the speculative cognitive phenomena whose very existence may be contingent upon recognition. The no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk monies of the earth-with-many-minds must be \u003Cem>intersubjective\u003C/em> and \u003Cem>contextual\u003C/em>, creative accounts of value in a field that both allows for and plausibly merges those accounts.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Ethereum’s distributed ledger will provide the infrastructure for this exploratory multiplicity, but the apps need to be built. They will be speculative, aesthetically charged; they will be science fiction realized, metaphysical discourse operationalized to results beyond all expectation; they will be harrowing acts of empathic technology, calm technology, optimistic and heterogenous accounts of right relations. A no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk revolution that realizes money as a democratic social technology at the same time as it embeds it in the panoply: no more cognitive privation, your surroundings suspiciously tenanted, and a new economy that runs off of the abundance, rather than the scarcity, of mind.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>As sure as history only encloses in order later to produce greater openings, the no\u003Cstrong>ö\u003C/strong>punk economic revolution is a technological and empirical inevitability.

Personally, I think this would require, on the one hand, a mass, decentralized experiment in biodata intermediation (along with other sensor technologies adequate to sociotechnical or collective minds) to the end of establishing direct feeds of intent or desire, and on the other, intent centric interfaces to radically diverse token economies that might contain those obscure intents. [5]\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>But this is a question with many answers.
